I was not the one making a blanket statement that just because \\\"I\\\" had no problems, that OTHER people were not having problems, caused by software. I work in IT, and I understand that identical hardware can ship from the factory with different firmware for any of a number of reasons. And guess what? The hardware isn't even identical. They are being made in different factories, using parts supplied from different vendors. All it takes is a single technician using an outdated firmware version for a day while updating the headset before shipping (or not doing his job and skipping the firmware update because \\\"muh, it will update automatically when they hook up to the PS5, and I am hungry and wanna go on break..\\\") before his supervisor finds out and corrects him, and boom.. You get 50-100 headsets out in the wild with old firmware, while MOST headsets have current version.So.. You literally don't know what you are talking about when you insist that no one else is having software problems that got fixed by an update. You DON'T understand the process of how these things get built and updated before they leave the factory, but like a lot of young aggro males, you INSIST you do. You are literally a walking definition of the Duning-Kruger Effect. See my link above. You don't know what you don't know, but you insist you know everything. One of the very worst things about young males.And, here's the thing.. At least one person reported actually getting a firmware upgrade notification on their headset already, so.. That kind of puts a little doubt on your absolute unyielding opinion that \\\"just because the patch notes did not talk about it, it didn't happen.\\\"But, let me clue you in on a little something, man. I know exactly why you are acting like you are. It is nothing more than hormones. You are young, likely in your early to mid 20s....If you are interested in the biology of it... We are basically mammalian predators, and do mammalian predator stuff. From the period of about puberty, until early middle age, all mammalian males (at least the ones aspiring to be alphas.. Males are always on a \\\"scale\\\" of aggressiveness..) go through a period of \\\"piss and vinegar\\\" where they tend to be ultra aggressive, and proving how much better they are than the local alpha male. They do so because of hormones whose function is to make them fight to prove how much more worthy they are as mates to females.This manifests in homo sapiens by being pretty aggro, over shit that just don't matter, when you think about it \\\"intellectually\\\", which is to say, taking the hormones out of the equation. There was literally no reason to insist no one else was having real issues being caused by firmware, just because \\\"you\\\" weren't having any issues. That's not how hardware/software works. Something in your hormones is telling you \\\"I'm right, he's wrong.\\\" And making you want to act aggressively to fight about who is right. And you don't even realize that this is WHY you act aggressively towards others.It's no big deal, really. I understand the biological underpinnings of it all, and younger male behavior is kind of amusing in a way. Like glass packs and loud subwoofers in the car? Bruh. That is classic animal \\\"display\\\" behavior. Being loud and obnoxious so females will look. Almost every species has some form of it.Please don't tell me you got glasspacks on, and subwoofers in your car.\"], [\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/11mvewm/i_cant_see_any_improvements_at_all/\", \"Null\", \"10 mo. ago\", \"Dude you're fucking crazy. look at this wall of text you wrote.

Yes, I'm mainly basing my opinion on speculation going off of past practices, and some insider information from those in the gateway.If you're interested in following the rabbit hole I jumped into, here it is;This article from last summer gave an idea of their next project.Team Asobi's next project will follow in the footsteps of the games it has done before, but will be a full-blown commercial title, \\\"andour biggest to date,\\\" says Doucet.Doucet says that Team Asobi has been making the most of its proximity to PlayStation's hardware team in Japan. \\\"We are one of the first people to get our hands onto prototypes. Even the DualSense, at the time we got it, it didn't look anything [like it does now]. It was a massive controller with boards and cables sticking out. But the features, the adaptive triggers, the haptic feedback... it was there. So we experimented with it.\\\"This tells me they have been one of THE FIRST to start working on the features of the PSVR2, even if its original form was goggles, circuit boards and velcro holding it all together in prototype form. SONY includes them from THE VERY start of new tech development.I 100% believe Astrobot will be there on launch day at minimum in the form of astros playroom with VR content added to show off the PSVR2s features.It's next official game is probably going to be a hybrid game that plays on BOTH flat PS5 and PSVR2 to reach a wider audience.Team Asobi hasn't missed a new system release since Astro's been a thing. I can't see Astro sitting PSVR 2 release day out, when VR cemented his fame.Playroom with the camera onlyPS4 release date 11/15/13Playroom VRPSVR release day 10/13/16Astro's playroom Ps5release date 11/12/20He wasn't around yet for the VITAs release in 2011, but still made an appearance in;The Playroom\\u2122 Toy Makerwhich was an AR experience just a few days after his PS4 debut! 11/21/13And soon,Astro's Playroom VR  PSVR2 launch day 2/22/23!Team asobi has already hadyears of access and development time with psvr2, while others are only just now getting access. They've been involved in some form since the prototype stage.Gt7s creator admitted recentlythat VR support was in mind from day one of development of GT7. If they were preparing for VR back then, it's not hard for me to believe the same was done for Astros Play room with Asobi having direct access to PSVR2 at the same time.There's also this videowhere Bryan from without Parole mentions not wanting to break embargo,listen and watch Bryan's body languagefrom the the 29:30 mark and on.He laughs when bringing up Astrobot as he tries to pass it off like he doesn't know. Then he continually smiles as Wes does his best to lay cover. Bryan goes out of his way to say that he feels people jumped the gun complaining about there not being an Astrobot at launch. He says he feels we will see news soon enough and that he'd be \\\"shocked\\\" if Astrobot wasn't there.Just afew shows agohe and AJ were right there with everyone else wondering where Astrobot was. Bryan was of the opinion there might be a playroom type release while AJ wanted Astro 2. Here they areagain speculatingwhy the announcements haven't come yet for the first party games.Now Bryan's completely relaxed on the topic. He's confident in whatever information he has, and it's not rumors he's basing it off of,it's facts.As far as why they don't just come right out and give all their inside information out,Bryan and Wes mention it here. They basically say it's because some of the information comes with an NDA from their sources. In order to keep their friendship and trust with their sources, they don't come right out and spill the info. This doesn't mean that Bryan has a good poker face when the topic comes up or he dances around some topics trying his hardest not to let something slip.But the MAIN reason for my belief is simply because of the source behind this quote;\\\"I am Astro Bot\\\"\"], [\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/114xjbz/without_parole_the_psvr2_game_announcements_keep/\", \"MikeFromSuburbia\", \"11 mo. ago\", \"\\ud83d\\ude4f\\ud83c\\udffb\"], [\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/114xjbz/without_parole_the_psvr2_game_announcements_keep/\", \"illuminati1556\", \"11 mo. ago\", \"I love your hype man, but you're setting people up for disappointment\"], [\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/114xjbz/without_parole_the_psvr2_game_announcements_keep/\", \"moogle_kupo\", \"11 mo. ago\", \"I've hyped myself up outta my damn MIND!

I honestly think the biggest limiting factor here is the PS5 itself and not the headset. Even with foveated rendering, there's only so much the PS5 can do. So render resolution has to be balanced for performance, either to hit a native 90fps or do 60fps and reprojected to 120hz, which creates a blurry effect. At lower render resolutions, we get aliasing and shimmering in the image. Also the mura effect of the OLED is pretty pronounced in certain scenes, adding to a grainy look at times. I don't think the sweet spot of the Fresnel is a major issue because once you are in the sweet spot, it's pretty clear, it's alot of these other things affecting the clarity.When you see a super sampled, high res game on PC VR (like on the Valve Index) especially at native 120hz where it just feels so crisp and smooth, you can see the difference, even with the Index lower resolution screen!PSVR2 honestly is coming quite close, and for the price value, it offers close to high end PC quality, just with some technical drawbacks for now.

Adjusting the tightness at the back, the position of the headband and moving the scope in and out also help.Basically, the edge clarity is not perfect on the Fresnel lenses, even in the sweet spot.

People are expecting Horizon to be the best it will be at launch, which is why they\\u2019re confused and let down by what they\\u2019re seeing. The game has a sort of bluish haze or mist to it most of the time, it\\u2019s not mura nor is it screen door, it seems to be a design choice in the game that is making the visuals to be less clear than I was expecting. The opening boat scene was not the blow away visual delight I was expecting to see. I had to stop it a few times to make sure I\\u2019d not got the set up wrong. The haptics were weak too, but worse was it just wasn\\u2019t this amazing clarity or sense of scale everyone was talking about. The thunderbird sweeping down was nothing to experience compared to the reactions we\\u2019d seen from those playing it. Maybe we knew what to expect and so there was no surprise, but the rumble was not very realistic feeling, it was just a PS3 controller style rumble and not in the least bit haptic. It\\u2019s still good and better than PSVR, but the whole thing has been set up to fail now. Everyone is expecting the best the system can possibly do from this, it\\u2019s almost a relief it isn\\u2019t though, it means we\\u2019ll get better experiences as the system grows.Jumping into Kayak straight after, I did mainly because both were shown to be graphically outstanding and the clarity and brightness of image talked about over and over. I was concerned that what I didn\\u2019t get in Horizon was going to be the case with Kayak and PSVR2 was going to be way more limited than we had been shown and promised. Kayak is much much better for clarity of image, there was none of this blue haze I was getting from Horizon. The lighting was incredible natural and the distant objects felt like they were better rendered. It was a huge relief to see what PSVR2 could do on day one. The haptics are still pretty weak though, I get the feeling that strongest setting is actually dialled down a lot to save battery life, which is already really short (especially in these early days of just playing for longer than we might usually to test everything out). If you get the chance to compare Kayak to Horizon, you should immediately see what I mean about clarity of the image (and that has nothing to do with the blurry images people are talking about due to not getting the sweet spot right, which is incredibly small).Puzzling Places is not exactly the most visually challenging game for the system, but was my third choice to play as I wanted to see how something simpler looked in the headset. This was a game that was made on PSVR and ported though. I feel some of the design choices and surroundings do reflect that tailored down design so it looked good in PSVR. Everything is very clear here, even when objects are right up in your face. Again, this was a relief over Horizon as that clarity talked about is being achieved in other games. The scenes were bright too. I do experience some pulsing of the image though. This would appear to be a tracking issue, but was something I was really hoping would no longer be a thing with PSVR2 as PSVR was plagued by this and didn\\u2019t help with motion sickness. I don\\u2019t understand why we\\u2019re getting it again now, but could be something to do with the systems over dependence on using the cameras to track your surroundings on top of the controllers. I think we all expected the system to just track controllers, but hopefully with updates this all improves.The room set up is definitely lacking options to override the defaults. The room scale scanning is not working for many, so the system should then just provide the option to set the floor space manually instead of just failing. The sitting space is just so incredibly small it\\u2019s hard to believe it\\u2019s what is intended. You have to sit and move as if you were packed in tight on the underground/subway. Relax in the slightest and your elbows and controllers are immediately outside of the boundary, and I\\u2019m quite a small person too, my children were both bigger than me from the age of 13, so for an average sized adult I can see the issue being even worse. Again, this just needs a software update so we can simply resize the area (we should also be able to resize our room scale set up without having to do the whole scan again, seems crazy you can\\u2019t just make an edit because you got a small area slightly wrong. I\\u2019ve now gone down the route of just setting that area to be the outside edge of my room, set over the top of all furniture. It means I can now sit and move anywhere I want and use the headset, but I will bump into the odd thing here and there of course).Overall, early days has not quite been what was expected, but it is obvious it can be so much better. The single cable for ease of set up is slightly marred by the fact the room scanning is a pain in the arse for many and not as granular as it should be. These are all software tweaks though, it feels like we\\u2019re in a system beta right now and we\\u2019ve got to get used to the fact this thing is going to evolve in the months to come as Sony update the system software and firmware.\"], [\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PSVR/comments/11bvvoy/pov_for_those_curious_about_psvr2_image_clarity/\", \"CarrotSurvivorYT\", \"10 mo. ago\", \"It\\u2019s way better than this with the headset on, the blur on the edges is not there when you are wearing it.
