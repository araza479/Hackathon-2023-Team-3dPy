Still, its brief races are speedy enough to keep me entertained between other activities, and I love how simple and easy it is to get online buddies playing together across platforms – even though its underdeveloped racing mechanics, lack of content, and absence of local multiplayer mean it struggles to stay fresh for too long.","Dec 22, 2023",60

As a 3rd-person to 1st-person VR adaptation, there are some compromises such as brief changes to a 3rd-person view during melee attacks and flat-screen cutscenes.

The procedural generation of the levels guarantees a remarkable replayability, while we would welcome the debut of more creatures in the future.

51,final fantasy xvi echoes of the fallen,PlayStation 5,COGconnected,Critic,"Final Fantasy XVI is crammed with narrative momentum. Which is amazing, until it’s time to do things like sidequests and DLC. Then the guillotine of the climax hangs over your head, impatient and sharp. In other words, it’s hard for me to get as invested in the DLC as I’d like. The combat is terrific, the new dungeon is beautiful, but it feels like I’m spinning my wheels. At the same time, I’ll take any excuse to spend more time with this game. Echoes of The Fallen is a great addition to a perfect Final Fantasy Experience.","Dec 14, 2023",74

Its few hours of gameplay offer an enjoyable dungeon experience with memorable enemy encounters that rival and even surpass those in the base game. While the narrative may not be the main attraction, it does set the stage for The Rising Tide DLC, which has been confirmed to be a more substantial experience.

62,hiveswap friendsim,PlayStation 5,PlayStation Country,Critic,Hiveswap Friendsim is a reasonably competent visual novel. The focus on friendship and the short chapters can make the act of relationships a little trivial. It can be a little too convenient at times and the writing lays on the humour thick.

The randomized boons make every run different and may sometimes push you to play with a different style than you normally would, and that's also a fun aspect of the mode. Meanwhile, the paid Purgatory DLC adds a great new weapon and a solid trio of songs, and between all of this, it's a decent excuse to spend six bucks and have a bunch of new fun with the game. I'm hopeful that the devs will tweak the ability to get those void crystals, though.","Dec 13, 2023",85

After the game, there are a couple of questions left that we never got an answer to.4)shooting. This is for the amateur. For me it was something new, to ride a bike and shoot villains.

125,murder house,Nintendo Switch,NintendoWorldReport,Critic,"If you are hankering for a campy, gory old school horror movie that you are in control of, you really can’t get much better than Murder House. It’s a game that doesn’t take itself too seriously and is not afraid to dump down a few buckets of blood every now and then. Dated things like tank controls or limited saves may be frustrating to a player not used to these types of games, but I honestly think this might be one of the better places to try those things out for the first time. The short runtime helps alleviate the stress of the controls and save mechanics, though the unfortunate crashing issues may replace that stress with frustration in the end. Hopefully a patch will be coming down the pipeline soon, but for now Murder House has found a good but technically troubled murder home on the Switch.","Oct 24, 2021",75

128,arashi castles of sin final cut,PlayStation 5,PlayStation Universe,Critic,"Arashi: Castle of Sin - Final Cut is held back from its full potential because it was originally a PS4 PSVR game. While the game has altered controls to match PSVR2, it still falls short of what we expect from a next-gen VR game, but not by much. The story and world had me clamoring for more. Jumping rooftop to rooftop, sneaking in the grass, and assassinating from the shadows made me want a full PSVR2 and PS5 game to take even more advantage of the world.","Dec 11, 2023",85

130,while the irons hot,PC,Hardcore Gamer,Critic,"What makes While the Iron’s Hot work is a combination of a pleasant series of tasks and quirky, entertaining characters in every new town and point of interest.  Nothing is particularly difficult, from crafting to puzzles, but it’s nice to visit Ellian and wander around, picking up jobs or helping people while beating metal into shape.  Even after the main plot is through there’s post-game content to play, completing the upgrade of buildings in the home town and taking on new quests while wrapping up any unfinished ones, all of which are documented in the journal.  There can be a lot to keep track of, but features like being able to pin a recipe or view the character list help when you need a reminder, and the whole game feels designed to make becoming a master blacksmith as accessible as possible.  While not particularly deep, While the Iron is Hot succeeds on charm and pure likeability, and it’s almost impossible to resist enjoying the blacksmithing journey through its world.","Dec 5, 2023",63

It was like a block buster movie that doesn't ****. It is exceptional and worth every penny.  You will have hundreds of hours’ worth of content if you buy this game.  Once you've put several hours in.  I’m usually not one to play a game more than once, but it’s 110% worth it for this game.  You have the option of picking 3 paths, and there are 5 different build types.  On your first playthrough you could go with the street kid, and go with a ninjatsu/reflex build, beat the game.  Now you can switch it up and go with Corpo, with a Int/Tech ability build.  The options are endless.  You can save your game and go through every possible scenario, it’s especially good in Phantom Liberty.  I never post-game reviews, but thought I should for this game, it’s just that good! The only games I’ve played twice ever in my life are GTA V, once on PS3 and again on PS4, and AC Black-flag, once on PS4 and again on Steam Deck.  This game is that good, you will not be disappointed.  I was blessed with playing this game for the first time a few months ago.  I rarely if at all ran into any bugs.  There was a mission that I had to exit the game and restart, other than that this game is good as gold.  It’s the best video game you can buy on the market right now.   It’s one of those rare games you can get completely lost in for hours, and it’ll be a long while before you have things to run out of do, like Witcher 3 in that aspect.","Dec 17, 2023",9.1

The game does not rely on a story, but rather on action, as it is a wonderful shooter that offers a lot of interactivity and fun, especially if you play together. The game has some technical sloppiness, but other than that it is an excellent adventure to experience. Do you have a VR headset? Then Arizona Sunshine 2 is worth your time.","Dec 18, 2023",80
151,arizona sunshine 2,PlayStation 5,papaBen,User,"I'm doing a second run on Apocalyptic difficulty after finishing it in a little over 7 hours, dragging along nicely. Normal mode for experienced players does not pose any particular difficulty. 
I invite you to do your first run in hard mode directly. You never feel the lack of ammunition, it's a walk as long as you aim for the head without emptying your magazine stupidly with each mob. 

The pleasure of progressing in the highest difficulty is really present, if you like FPS don't miss it. The game has largely paid off for me. 

The only negative point that I hope will be changed with an update is the red screen when you die which is much too long given that we have a small loading behind.","Dec 11, 2023",7.2
152,arizona sunshine 2,PlayStation 5,TheGamerGuide,User,"Arizona Sunshine 2 shows just what fun the PSVR 2 can be if utilised correctly. I had a blast blowing off limbs of the undead and participating in some extremely satisfying reload animations. It may not win awards for its story, but it's easily one of the best titles to utilise the power and technology of the PSVR 2. There is endless fun to be had alone or with up to four buddies.

TGG – 8 / 10

AUDIO 9/10
The sound design is equally solid. The zombies sound terrifying, and our protagonist does a great job even though hearing him call every zombie Fred gets annoying rather quickly.

VISUALS 8/10
Visually, the game is very impressive. There is plenty of detail worldwide and many more locations than the original, from town neighbourhoods. Hospital buildings and military bases are just a few examples.

PLAYABILITY 7/10
Not much of a memorable story, but plenty of fun with Cooperative play and various ways to take down the undead.

DELIVERY 8/10
Arizona Sunshine 2 is an absolute blast. With its fantastic and precision gunplay, other titles would do well to follow it in the VR landscape. It may not feature a memorable story, but it’s easy to make your memories with all the various ways to take down the undead.","Dec 11, 2023",8

For fans of the original like myself, the biggest downside about Ark: Survival Ascended may be that buying this game is basically becoming a required investment if you want to keep enjoying Ark. Because as I understand it, Studio Wildcard is working actively to phase out the original game, having already shut down its official servers. This leaves players with no option but to upgrade.

The feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction from a job well done is real, and I can have more success thanks to the elimination of some of the complexities. I’ve enjoyed my time with Truck and Logistics simulator, and only wish it had more options ready for its $39.99 launch.","Jun 29, 2020",80
189,truck and logistics simulator,Nintendo Switch,LeithalAU,User,"Just from the title this screams fun right? Well I was honestly very hesitant to pick this up but after being convinced by the dev. To try it out, I was honestly surprised at how detailed this game is. There are a large number of vehicles to choose from, missions to complete and once you master the controls of driving, the game draws you in and you just have to keep playing to figure out each vehicle’s unique controls and how adding in the weight of your cargo effects how the vehicle drives on and off road.

What struck me most about this game is the planning and execution of each mission. You start off in a warehouse and get in a loader to put boulders into a dump truck before making the delivery on the road. Other off road missions include driving a forklift (without a license!) It is the kind of thing that white collar people like me live for, to be able to play around in this environment without any of the danger of real world consequences. A little glitch with this is when loading cargo on if you do accidentally do it lopsided or oddly placed, the game will auto-fix it. It takes a little of the challenge away of having to fix this yourself and try and drive.

There are a wide range of vehicles to choose from (over 20 I believe) and while the mechanics are essentially the same, each vehicle has its own individual way of handling. This took me about three quarters of my time was figuring out weight distribution and balancing the vehicle on the road through different terrains and environments. Usually in a simulator game like this it is not as detailed as this game is. There is a real world element feel to this that sets it apart from anything else in the same genre. The game also does a really surprising thing and lets you unlock games rather quickly. There are no long slogs here trying to unlock more vehicles resulting in less **** required. While this doesn’t reduce the amount of time you spend with the game necessarily, it does provide a more satisfying experience that will propel and motivate you onto the next delivery to earn the money required.

Camera wise this game offers two viewpoints, one internal and one external camera that are easy to manipulate in tight spaces when you need both with a larger vehicle. Going hand in hand with this is the detailed graphics that show the love and effort that have gone into this game. The internal of each vehicle looks scarily realistic and help create the illusion of manning the trucks. What was a little lacking was the traffic externally, now we are in stage 3 lockdown at the moment so there are less cars on the world IRL, however to make this game a little more challenging I would have appreciated some more traffic, particularly in the city to help it feel a little close to real world.

When it comes to open world, you use your GPS navigation system to travel to your destination. You can veer away from this and it will find an alternate route if you want to take a bit longer. Long missions do rake in more cash but will take more of your gameplay time. I found a good mix up of timed missions helped keep the gameplay feeling fresh easing out the repetition.

As a simulator this game provided me with everything that I was expecting and then exceeded them. The smooth transitions from warehouse to road to giving players an open world to drive around was seamless and helped create an immersive experience. The game works with keyboard and mouse and spectacularly if you have a controller connected, I found the Xbox Elite Series 2 a great controller for this experience. If you are looking for the most realistic sim out there for trucks, this is definitely the game to play.","Aug 13, 2020",7.0
190,this means warp,PC,Softpedia,Critic,"This Means Warp is designed to appeal to players who can get a group of friends together and get them to join in cooperative play. The main mechanics of combat and repairing are easy to understand but as soon as more than one human is involved, everything can quickly devolve into chaotic fun. Time and energy will allow groups to become expertly-drilled crews. The title’s biggest issue is how repetitive the gameplay loop is. This is mitigated when more than one player is involved. But a solo game with computer companions will be frustrating.

372,warhammer age of sigmar realms of ruin,PC,TurtleFlop,User,"In its current state I'd call this game more of a 7.5 to an 8, but I'm giving it the extra point to counteract some of the absolute nonsense diehard fans of the Old World are spouting about the setting.

Realms of Ruin is a highly tactical game - not strategic, there's no base building to speak of and you won't find yourself managing the tax infrastructure of some sprawling empire. What you WILL be doing is proactively managing battle-winning abilities across a meaty handful of units fighting on multiple fronts, placing a huge emphasis on clever timing, unit positioning, and using the right tool for the right job. 

The roster for each faction is relatively tight and the unit counter circle isn't complex in and of itself, but what that means is that every unit has an opportunity to shine if used correctly. The pace of combat has been called slow - that's intentional, to give players time to make decisions about where and when to utilize abilities to turn the tide of conflict.

When this game is humming, the flow of battle is anything BUT ponderous, as you'll be snapping between fronts, teetering on the knife's edge between disaster and glorious victory, pulling units in and out of the fight, and teeing off abilities at opportune moments to cripple and counter your foes. It's a mighty good time, and even when playing against the AI the game can prove satisfyingly challenging.

If you like games that forego grand strategy and base management in favor of a focus on tactical decision making, tight unit counts, and playmaking through well-time ability usage, you'll have a good time here. Good spiritual comparisons would be Dawn of War 2, Spellforce, and Company of Heroes.","Nov 20, 2023",6.9

393,jagged alliance 3,PC,Kalev,User,"A few common points of criticism towards the game and my thoughts on why I DISAGREE WITH THOSE:
• No active pause – I think that being able to set up perfect ambushes with your whole squad by executing a number of orders in perfect sync would ruin the experience for me. You can still set up brilliant ambushes by, say, planting a timed explosive and putting most of your squad in overwatch before the turn-based combat starts so that the enemy still suffers a lot of damage in the repositioning phase.
• No chance to hit displayed – while the option has already been provided with an official mod, I seriously don’t get it what so many people are complaining about. You are explicitly shown tons of information about what could affect your chances to hit positively or negatively, sometimes up to 9-10 such data points in my experience. If that were not enough, you actually get a visual indication of whether your attempt is in the sweet spot based on all those factors combined with range.
• Quirky controls – I’ve found it way more easier to go to a different floor as compared with XCOM2. Controls are fairly intuitive and responsive from my point of view, especially appreciating the fact that so much is going on that I can’t really blame the game for not always being fully clear as to what exactly I’m trying to do.
• Enemy knowing where you are – I’ve noticed some reviewers have claimed that the AI knew more than it should. While I appreciate the fact they may have had such experience, I haven’t. I’ve had a number of situations where I’m openly attacking the enemy with part of the squad while some other mercs stay hidden to attack from the flank. It seemed that the AI was only aware of my openly attacking mercs and wasn’t anticipating the hidden mercs that were sometimes literally in front of its way. If they’d been able to do a 1-hit kill with a suppressed sniper, they’d remain hidden and the AI would definitely still be unaware of where they were.
• Ragdoll physics can be subpar; what your merc wears doesn’t change their looks – both statements are correct and I seriously couldn’t care less. I’m here for the gameplay which is brilliant – if that’s at the expense of some more eye candy, then so be it.

What I particularly liked about the game:
• Good and challenging AI even at the lowest difficulty
• I did explore every single tile on the map and I still see a great replayability potential. It’s very much non-linear indeed and you can progress with even some of the major milestones in a campaign by approaching them in a different order. Your decisions do indeed matter in the long term and I bet I could see a lot more from the game even in a third or fourth replay – the point is that it’s not only alternative choices (where I could just explore 100% of those alternatives in a second playthrough) but rather your choices cumulatively also lead to very different outcomes. Side quests are brilliant and very immersive.
• The game came out extremely polished and with more than enough content for it to be called a worthy day one release. That used to be the standard twenty years ago but not really the case anymore so it’s very much worth praising the developers and the publishers for that. I’ve played for more than 60 hours so far and I haven’t had a single crash or any major bug spoiling my experience. The game is also full of so much content that it’s most certainly a fully completed launch – unlike many other moder releases that are launched but only become playable after months and potentially even some paid DLCs.
• Love the projectile ballistics!

What could’ve made the game even better:
• Lacking tutorials – as a newcomer to the game and the series (but definitely not to the genre), I gave up on my first playthrough after about 10 hours because I’d made some fundamental strategy mistakes. I then spent about an hour of watching videos on YouTube with titles like “5 major mistakes to avoid when playing JA3”, etc. After that I had tons of fun with my full 50-hours completionist playthrough. Nevertheless, a proper engaging in-game tutorial would’ve been appreciated. I did my best to try to read all of the text just-in-time tips but felt overwhelmed with the walls of text at some point.
• I mentioned already that I love the projectile ballistics but as much as I was hyped about the destructible terrain, I must say Silent Storm still remains unmatched in that respect. Yes, many objects and parts of the terrain are indeed destructible but I couldn’t help but think all the time how Silent Storm was far superior in that respect. Don’t get me wrong – destruction is good, I’m happy it’s there in the first place, it’s just simply not as absolutely brilliant and fun as it was in Silent Storm.

Despite the two points above, I had so much fun that I realise it's greater than the sum of its parts, hence 10/10.","Aug 3, 2023",8.1

I fall into the former category and I am happy with this DLC. The game took me about 20 hours to complete and I spent at least 50% of my playtime with a silly grin over getting to see these characters banter and interact again. Although this DLC doesn’t reinvent the wheel—and there are no new combat characters or artes—it does improve on several complaints I had on the 2nd half of the main story. The pacing, dungeon quality, side quest quality, and final boss are a definite step up. If I had to nitpick then I do think the final dungeon dragged on a bit too long, but this was the only time I felt the pacing was off. I enjoyed the focus on Alphen’s arc in this DLC, which was well deserved after Shionne’s arc was arguably the emotional core of the base game.

Overall, this was a wonderful opportunity to reunite with the Arise cast and go on one last well-paced journey that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Would recommend.","Nov 12, 2023",9

______________________________________________________

Comparison to past Dirt Rally titles/Generations:
- Stages from 17 countries instead of 6, the stages have a lot more design and environmental variety that really elevates the fun factor. A vital component, the main challenge of Rally, is the roads, and EA WRC does this multiple factors better than past Dirt Rally entries. The benefit perceived here compared to the compromise in overall visuals is hands down elevates the gameplay experience, so the move to UE was well worth it.
______________________________________________________
<< Driving physics >> similar underpinnings to DR 2.0 but with overall more grip (makes the game move a bit towards the sim-cade end of the spectrum, making it more accessible to general consumers). However I feel this is not a detriment, in fact I honestly prefer WRC's driving model over DR 2.0's, because the feel of the car is better on a wheel. Once the settings are dialed in to how I had it in DR2.0 (reduced settings besides Self-align, Suspension, Tyre Slip to 60%), you feel more in the FFB than in DR, better gravel texture, feedback through bumps/crests/dips are intuitive and as you would expect, tyre slip when understeering especially on tarmac is also great. 
<< Tarmac physics >> expect much higher cornering speeds (simcade), but with much better feel of the surface which IMO makes it actually fun to drive on tarmac compared to DR2.0. You feel the car has traction and you can really lean into the turns which still require you to keep within the tyre's grip limit.
<< WRC1 car physics >> amazing, better than Generations. The way the car dives diagonally on its compliant suspension as you balance it on the brakes slowing from a straight to a curve is just like you would expect from watching WRC as the downforce does its work. Flinging the car around tight turns and exploiting gear 1/2 for 4wd oversteer works as you'd expect and is lots of fun.
<< Other cars >> expect the same quality as the WRC1 cars as expected from DR2.0, better hands down than in Generations especially the sounds. Greatly improves the career experience as the new structure leans into its pool of rally cars outside of the WRC route.
______________________________________________________
<< Career >> actually really well designed. For the people complaining it strays too far from the main WRC events, you can just skip the invitationals/other events and choose to rest on the weeks that don't have WRC events. For everyone else, it gives you the opportunity to enter other championships using its many other car classes, and gives you a taste of special cars for free in Invitationals. It's a constant rotisserie of all types of rally cars and stages around the world. Better than DR2.0 that locks you into one car class for a whole year, let alone Generations. There is not so much micro-managing your team so you get to race more often which is good, but upgrading your engineers to reduce cost/time of repairs is always nice. Benefactor system means you can borrow huge amounts of money to take a Group B for a spin at the risk of Max's happiness meter, which is always nice.
<< Damage >> I run Hardcore damage and no Restarts, which IMO makes career so much better. I have to drive carefully and have to decide when to push. Car damage is really well balanced with the Service repair allowance so you actively weigh the risk of taking on more damage from pushing or mitigate damage. In longer services you get 30mins which is enough to repair 2 or so major components which do affect your pace. DR 2.0 I found the car barely gets damaged so services are trivial.

All of the puzzle pieces that are given in item descriptions and dialogue, end up falling a little short when it comes to giving a complete picture of what exactly is happening. However, as much as it is a **** also feels a bit like a positive. The story leaves you with questions and it also leaves some things up for interpretation.

I genuinely related to Thirsty Suitors in ways I’ve never connected to a video game before and would love to revisit Jala and company in DLC or a sequel. Thirsty Suitors isn’t just a stock game with a Bollywood veneer; it’s an entity that showcases both obvious and subtle aspects of South Asian culture in the West.

The continuous Career Mode is a surface level addition, but like much with this game with proper investment, there’s a lot more that could go into it. The fact that you can only play as a created player no matter the mode or team is both a blessing and a curse. It would be great to play with different quarterbacks of different sizes and attributes. You are playing against these players, after all. The multiplayer that was added is basically non-existent unless you have a friend who has a headset. The mini-games are more frustrating than they are fun, but the quickest way to play with friends is the Two-Minute Drill. This, and the practice mode, is the best way to get the feel for the game.

With no alternate paths to take on future playthroughs, replay value is entirely based on clearing the game at higher difficulties. It may be enough to keep genre enthusiasts engaged for an hour or two, but it lacks the diverse number of permutations, so loved by high score seekers, that can be found in its inspiration. FUR Squadron is a reasonably well executed love letter to Star Fox and rail shooters in general, and it is clear that the potential is there for this developer to pull off something of a much larger scale. It is short and simple, but a fun diversion for genre fans if only for an afternoon.","Mar 15, 2023",70

Career Mode has been fine tuned with welcome lifestyle improvements and a deeper story with Coach Davis.

905,hotline miami collection,Nintendo Switch,Gameblog.fr,Critic,"Six years after its initial release on PC, Hotline Miami is offered with its suite Hotline Miami 2 : Wrong Number (2015) on Switch, through Hotline Miami Collection. If the two titles have been available for some years now on PlayStation consoles including PS Vita, the attraction of being able to play these two cult titles on a portable console such as that of Nintendo is obvious. Hotline Miami games always offer a cryptic story ticking all the boxes of subversiveness, hypnotizing like the bloody scrums in which it plunges us, the cries of flamboyant synthesizers and heavy and threatening beats. Two of the best titles of the decade to discover or re-discover for a discerning audience.","Sep 2, 2019",82
906,hotline miami collection,Nintendo Switch,GamingTrend,Critic,"With satisfyingly difficult gameplay and a soundtrack that steals the show, the Hotline Miami collection is a double feature that offers much replay-ability. While the sequel is more of the same gameplay wise, it expands the series lore and introduces new characters and concepts. The games run smooth on the Switch's hardware and the console's portability makes this the ideal way to play Hotline Miami.","Oct 6, 2019",85

908,hotline miami collection,Nintendo Switch,PacoBN23,User,"Hotline Miami 1 y 2 son dos juegos de violencia extrema y de combates frenéticos que enganchan desde el primer momento.

La historia es interesante y, aunque no sea nada del otro mundo, también es un incentivo para seguir jugando.

Lo más destacable del juego es su jugabilidad, obligándote a pensar una estrategia si no quieres morir una vez tras otra. A veces llega a ser frustrante porque vas a morir mucho, pero la satisfacción que recibes cuando te pasas un nivel es enorme.

En cuanto al apartado artístico, por un lado, la banda sonora está muy bien y acompaña perfectamente a los niveles y a los menús. En cuanto a los gráficos, el estilo pixel art es muy bonito y el diseño de niveles, de personajes y de máscaras es excelente.

Es un indie de culto que todos deben jugar al menos una vez.

En Switch los controles dejan bastante que desear.","Jun 24, 2023",9

- Well-balanced narrative.
- Gameplay is easy to learn.
- Characters!

Cons.:
- Need resolution change.
- Car chase moment was unclear how to play and forces to replay multiple times which soured the impression (it is at the end - negative feeling does not fade until the end).

933,enchanted portals,PlayStation 5,KeenGamer,Critic,Xixo Game Studios' Enchanted Portals has given us some of the magic of Cuphead but not much else. Though its art style and boss fights capture the essence of its inspiration. The sluggish gameplay and mechanics completely let it down alongside its dull story and choice of presentation.

U just pressing some button for movement or to shoot u need to wait like 1 sec and then ur character start do smth. The final boss (bosses) just random like russian roulette. Especiaaly Mrs. Frog, whose probably can kill superman. Idea is ok, but realisation very bad. Pls stop making games, because u cant do this. And if you want to do TV series of this game, like cuphead, just stop. Think twice, because u will have 0 dollars after 3 month of ur releases.
