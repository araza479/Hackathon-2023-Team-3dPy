It was fucking awesome and it makes me sad that they got rid of that level of customisation for our consoles (even if it was in a theme that probably millions of people used, so hardly unique, but still...)Just let me put some screencaps as wallpapers dammit"
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/15eb7ki/no_more_waking_the_wife/,whoopsitisathrowaway,5 mo. ago,Customizableanythingwould be something. I honestly hate that the most about this supposedly ‚Äúmodern‚Äù gen of consoles. You should literally be able to adjust any setting or display theme/color/sound you want with ease and it‚Äôs kind of a joke that we can‚Äôt. PS4 at least had themes and some other features that helped spice it up. But PS5 still has absolutely nothing you can customize in the UI almost 3 years in now.
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/15eb7ki/no_more_waking_the_wife/,BlueLungsBlackHeart,5 mo. ago,"Wait seriously? NO customization on the PS5?! That‚Äôs wild. I already thought PS4 was lackluster in that department. God I miss the PS3. XMB layout was the goat, and you could fully customize everything from dynamic backgrounds to sound effects and menu icons. Such a shame."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/15eb7ki/no_more_waking_the_wife/,AmmarAnwar1996,5 mo. ago,Nearly three years since launch and they haven't added any custom themes. The fun themes you claimed on PS4 can't be used on the PS5.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/15eb7ki/no_more_waking_the_wife/,Possible_Cicada3598,5 mo. ago,I would LOVE to be able to customize the color of the light on the PS5. It irritates me to no end that every single ad or official photo from Sony of the PS5 shows it with the blue light even though you only see that light when it flashes for a few seconds on bootup. Clearly they know the blue light looks best or they wouldn't constantly show it off. Yet we're stuck with the boring white light when it's on.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/15eb7ki/no_more_waking_the_wife/,whoopsitisathrowaway,5 mo. ago,Yeah let me go spend hours of time I don‚Äôt have building a PC from the ground up with money I don‚Äôt have (and get scalped on the component prices) just to get perpetually frustrated with different settings not working correctly on most games I play since I have no clue about PC specs or settings. So then I have to scour online forums and dead message threads hoping to find the information I need to fix the very specific things I already have a minimal understanding of.And then when I inevitably turn to a ‚Äúconstructive atmosphere‚Äù like Reddit for help I‚Äôll get told I‚Äôm a moron for not having studied computer science since age 10 and already knowing the answer intuitively.

It was basically fully customizable. Could even create your own shells for different layouts and what not, super dope stuff. I really wish Sony would allow customization features like that, along with backgrounds/themes for the console. Even being able to add more to the home screen options like the ps3 where you have your friends list, web browser, etc. Would be dope as fuck.

If there‚Äôs a power outage and it‚Äôs on at the time it almost always goes to brain dead mode and takes some time to get it to reboot correctly.Is it just the power adapter? Or is it on its way out?It‚Äôs not just like the normal five beeps that I‚Äôve read online in relation to the power adapter thingy. It‚Äôs like 3-5 minutes of beeps. And there‚Äôs no problem and it boots normally when coming back from a full shut down.

Spider-Man can lift hundreds of tons of weight when needed, like the famous building falling on him scene.Let's put aside how his physical muscles are that strong, how his bones can take that kind of torque, how his skin is so strong it won't shred under the strain (but will tear and. bleed when shot or when glass hits it), we don't even need to talk about that.How much does Peter fucking eat? It takes energy to lift things, can't get around that. Peter casually lifts things millions of times  heavier than any human ever could. That energy has to come from somewhere, and our human organic bodies get it from calories. Does he eat ten thousand burgers every time he is off screen? Does he have ultra-acid stomach? Is his shit rocketing through his system to make room for more? It must be coming from some sort of pocket dimension. So does he need to eat at all?But it's the webbing that bothers you?"

It can help make the 23rd time Spidey fought Doctor Octopus fresh compared to the first 22.In movies, there's usually not enough time to spend on it to make it interesting.  Just like there's not much time spent on the Spider-Sense (which also doesn't fit nicely into generic ""spider-powers"").  Or how they don't generally have much time for Spider-Man's extended supporting cast, which get a lot more depth in the books.But that's the point of Spider-Man: they aren't just generic spider-powers, and everything that made him special didn't come from a radioactive spider bite.  It's an extended soap opera that operates best in serialized storytelling where there's lots of time to 'waste' on details that aren't very streamlined."

But on the controller, you usually press the blue X to confirm and the red circle to cancel.I've never been a fanboy of any particular console company, but Microsoft just absolutely nailed their four lettered face buttons.  Four distinct and memorable colors and arranged in a logical way (Green A means Go, Red B means Stop), your thumb goes higher on the controller to go up the alphabet from A to B or X to Y.  Sorry to be a western chauvinist, but if a controller has four face buttons: Microsoft's layout should absolutely be the standard.

Compare that to the 117 Million PS4s sold over it's lifetime and you have less than 2% of PS4 owners who played Bloodborne.Having played Demons Souls on the PS3 and Bloodborne when it launched I can definitely see why they're not popular among general audiences.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/zxtxpr/how_playstation_sees_their_game_franchises/,B-Bog,1 yr. ago,I will never understand Reddit's obsession with this game. It is so utterly bland and run-of-the-mill in almost every aspect except for hordes (which are woefully under-utilized in the campaign) and the writing (which is embarassingly bad). That's not even to speak of the piss-poor state the game released in.
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/zxtxpr/how_playstation_sees_their_game_franchises/,Snake2k,1 yr. ago,"I dropped Days Gone when it came out and finished it later on PS5.I'll say that the game does these things good: Vehicle/Survival mechanics, Zombies, Gun/Crafts.Besides that it's basically any other mediocre open world game with even less stuff. Not just that, there are alot of bad things that ruin the good stuff above. For example, the fact that you can fast travel from anywhere to anywhere else ruins the ""running out of gas & bike breaking down in the middle of a tunnel filled with zombies"" potential of the survival aspect of the game.The single worst little detail that broke that game for me then and it is one of the reasons why I won't touch it again: Floating flashlight.I know it's a super minor nit, but like... Not a single dev or QA person go like ""hey ummm.. we're making a horror game right? Shouldn't this be fixed?""Someone somewhere decided to make a HORROR SURVIVAL GAME and forgot to attach the flashlight to the front of the chest like in virtually any other horror game?That single detail showed me how little they actually cared to build the game properly.You could rotate the camera behind you, Deacon could be looking straight ahead, but a magical floodlight could show you the entire world behind him.Now that being said though, I think the game had some solid foundations that could lead to an amazing open world zombie survival action game (with maybe some co-op aspects like in Dying Light 1, not 2 cus 2 sucked).

I'm almost 48.My Mom could still probably kick my ass as Space Invaders and Asteroids. My Dad played games until he bought me the Sega Master System in 87. He played that for a while, but stopped for a bit. He played a few computer games, but nothing big. In the late 90's, though, after I moved out and took my PC, he had to build his own. He got back into gaming quite a bit. Quake 3, NOLF, Flight Simulator, Unreal Tournament, and a ton more. We kept trying to beat each other on our computer builds on who did the better one. Once he retired (~12 years ago), he just wanted to relax. His computer sits dormant... My Mom killed his Windows install a couple years ago, and it's never gotten fixed... Dad is doing awesome, though. Just wanted more relaxing hobbies. :)I still play games, have a decent collection of consoles from Pong to the PS5 and everything in between. I still love gaming, and my parents really helped with that. The one button Atari controller was fine, the NES was good, the SNES was amazing. The Xbox and PS controllers are amazing.However - I still struggle with the L3/R3 button. I have to think about it sometimes... :)"

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/107lshl/the_pain/,StacheBandicoot,1 yr. ago,"Yeah, same I only go for them in games that I naturally was nearly done with the trophies just by playing through them and it won‚Äôt take much longer to go through and get the rest. Or ones I look up before I start and they seem easy to complete while doing a play through, I always do a quick missable search when I start any game so I don‚Äôt miss easy trophies or worthwhile quest lines, and then if the other achievements that I see when looking that up seem reasonable then I might go for it. That pretty much precludes most open world games from even bothering to go for them. Last open world I can remember getting the platinum in was Spider-Man and that‚Äôs because the game graciously had a perk to display the collectibles on the map, although I honestly found most of them before that on my own just by exploring the map and having fun, that just helped in the end with the few that get missed, and it was a relatively easy game besides that.I just remember specifically from when I cared that the collectible achievements in Skyrim are actually really easy if you just immediately go for them (and even easier if you exploit the crafting/enchanting/potion game mechanics) at the start of a game and ignore the rest of it. Which is better to target in a fresh run through because sometimes you can accidentally kill the wrong thing, or not pick up an item and it can be deleted or fall through the map or despawn if you‚Äôve been playing on a save for awhile. So I just headed to whiterun, maxed my stats then beelines to the collectibles before the game file can get too messed up and things are flown all over the place. (The vampires which kill npcs can maybe be a bit of a problem though if dawnguards installed and you level too quickly at the the start). Obviously if one‚Äôs still missing a lot of other quest progress and stuff too it could take forever to platinum that game though. Just if collectibles were holding the platinum back that alone could be done a lot quicker than a lot of other open world games where Skyrim doesn‚Äôt even have half of those sort of achievement related collectibles that some other games do, and skyrim‚Äôs actually have a function in the game too and aren‚Äôt just meaningless tokens which is nice."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/107lshl/the_pain/,Popular-Pressure-239,1 yr. ago,"Not the original commenter but I usually tend to platinum only open world games simply because it‚Äôs easier to do. Things aren‚Äôt usually missable, Vs single player games. Plus a lot of games (especially Naughty Dog) require multiple playthroughs or completion on certain difficulties."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/107lshl/the_pain/,StacheBandicoot,1 yr. ago,"I‚Äôm the opposite. But it depends on if the game lets you revisit past levels and content or has missable achievements or an end game after the final boss/level/cutscene that lets you go back and explore the game, or has a new game+ worth playing. Things might not be missable in some open world games, but they might not be in a single player/ linear games either, especially ones that lets you go back, either way you‚Äôre revisiting past content to find something, and usually in single player games it‚Äôs easier and faster to identify what‚Äôs missing and where, especially if it has a counter for different sections of the game/ collectibles.In a lot of open world games you‚Äôre in the weeds trying to figure out what‚Äôs missing unless you‚Äôre keeping a checklist as you play which can be tedious or unfun, and easily prone to error. Open world games are often much longer too and can also have sets of achievements that preclude getting other achievements demanding a second, third, fourth play through, etc. even worse than some single player games do, while it‚Äôs fairly easy to search up missable in a linear game before you start it and just get them along the way. I really can‚Äôt think of too many linear games that had more than like 3-5 missable achievements/trophies throughout the game to be mindful of while playing, and usually those are just triggering an event, conversation or a gag object slightly out of the beaten path to click on.Honestly it‚Äôs usually pointless collectibles that hold back a platinum for me, open world or not. I‚Äôll take the time to unlock side missions and useful content though. It‚Äôs not that hard to quickly walk down the hallway that is obviously the wrong way for 10 seconds for things like this in a lot of linear games, often you want to anyway, I want the extra health/orbs in a classic god of war game for example so I‚Äôm going to walk every which way looking for those as I play and get them all because they have an impact on the gameplay. It‚Äôs often just easier to notice than something tucked away in an open world too. While in a lot of open world games certain sets of collectibles do nothing, which can also be the case in a linear game but sometimes the collectibles unlock levels or something and aren‚Äôt just meaningless objects to click on/walk over once like they usually are in an open world game. You mention naughty dog and I haven‚Äôt got the platinum in any of their games. Going back to their fist game that had them, I almost did platinum the first uncharted but I missed like 3 of the pointless collectibles that didn‚Äôt impact the game at all and I didn‚Äôt bother to go back in and get them and never bothered caring or trying for achievements in any of their games ever sense then.I finished all their games story content though. Whereas I often don‚Äôt ever even finish the game / story in a lot of open world games before I tire of them, much less their trophies, which means I‚Äôm not getting their platinum either way because most have a trophy tied to competing their story line. The amount of open world games i cared about concluding or even consider the end of the game a goal worth reaching is pretty sparse, the plot of a lot of them is just not so worthwhile. Open world games usually just simply take longer to complete too, 60-200+ hours to throughly get through sometimes when I can entirely complete a more linear game and get its platinum with minimal effort in one or two sittings in like 3-20 hours usually without really even trying or thinking about it. It‚Äôs more quasi open world games that can be difficult, borderlands 2 for example, or ones that require multiple play throughs like you said (or that have multiplayer achievements) that can sometimes take forever and I don‚Äôt bother with getting those. Linear single player games though are the bulk of my trophies though, they comprise the majority of the different games I‚Äôve played too. I‚Äôve played only maybe 15-20 open world games probably, and I‚Äôve put over 100 hours in certain open world games just messing around, that I have only like 5 trophies in."

What fun could there possibly be in just going step by step and not discovering these rewards on your own?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/107lshl/the_pain/,new_account_5009,1 yr. ago,"Probably depends on the game and the specific achievement. A lot of games reward the player with additional stuff for collecting the optional collectibles, so people want that optional stuff. In Plants vs. Zombies GW2, collecting all the gnomes gave you a crown to wear in multiplayer with a narrator commenting every time you get a kill. In the rebooted Crash Team Racing, collecting all the hidden crates unlocked the crate itself as a playable character you could race as. In GTA 3, collecting the hidden packages gave you increasingly rare guns at your safe spot.That said, plenty of people's OCD traits come out when it comes to trophies in games. Seeing a game with 95% completion isn't good enough, so people will power through the collectibles while watching a guide to track down everything to say they've seen 100% of what a game offers. Rather than spending hundreds of hours looking at every possible surface in a huge open world map like in GTA V, people leverage the work that others have already done."

To be honest, I've lots of games in PS+ monthly and catalog on my 'really want to play' list (especially when doing 'em platinum) to cover at least a year of waiting. If I really want to play and buy a game, I just have to wait a few months to have them hit for around ‚Ç¨$30 on the secondhand market. This way I purchased Horizon Forbidden West for ‚Ç¨20 about 6 months after release. The game was still hot to join the conversations on both Reddit and real life.I personally don't understand people buyingmostof their games at the initial price point. A few games a year, no problem, but most? Enjoy a PS+ game and enjoy a discount afterwards. Use the money to spend either on new gaming gear or save up for either those initial purchases or even 'real life' expenses (such as food, washing machine, pension fund, etc.)."

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10f4xbn/its_a_welcome_change/,Bismofunyuns4l,1 yr. ago,"Spores really aren‚Äôt that important to the games, and don‚Äôt really make much sense in the real world when you think about it. Spores would be picked up by the wind and carried all over, people would basically always need the masks on. And going through one of those spore infested buildings would require you to basically remove your clothes and wash your body thoroughly before you could even consider taking off the mask.The scenes with Joel and Dina seeing that Ellie is immune could easily be replaced with bite marks for the same effect. Joel already saw the FEDRA scanner in the first episode so the spores aren‚Äôt needed for him to believe.The way the tendrils work in the show also amplifies the horror and intensity of the fungus. Those tendrils form a hive mind like network, so when  moving through a highly infected area, the tendrils could potentially alert the infected in the area, which wouldn‚Äôt really work for the stealth in the game, but definitely adds to the the tension for the show. One wrong step and all the infected in the area are now coming for you. Scary stuff.All in all, I think spores work better for the game and the tendrils work better for the show. The story is really about the characters and the trauma they have to overcome, not the infection itself."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10f4xbn/its_a_welcome_change/,ChakaZG,1 yr. ago,"Cordyceps already can't infect humans in the real world, so that ship has sailed. That aside, if my memory serves me right the gametells usthat the spores are not dangerous outside because of low concentration. That's obviously not the case in closed up rooms like basements, where the concentration will be far greater. I mean, inhaling small amounts of rat shit will infect you with the hantavirus, let alone an entire rotting corpse emitting fungi in a confined space. Makes more than enough sense."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10f4xbn/its_a_welcome_change/,Chavarlison,1 yr. ago,"Did you just argue for and against the realism in one go? The low concentration doesn't make sense really, the amount of infected would insure there is a fuckload of spores to go around. It would have had a 100% infection rate once enough of them get to the sporing stage. The starting town won't be livable and any towns would have to be located in the most remote locations i.e. away from water. The decision to forgo the spores was probably more of a creative one to let the actors go without masks. The mask for the game wasn't much of a hindrance since you are playing in the third person overhead view."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10f4xbn/its_a_welcome_change/,Skadij,1 yr. ago,"My understanding of the population of infected was that at the beginning of the outbreak, over 60% of the world‚Äôs population had been infected. Then (in the US at least) QZs of non-infected people were established and cities were bombed to hell. There are still infected in cities but Tommy implies in Part II that they seem to migrate. I think the rate at which the infected ‚Äúreproduce‚Äù is on the lower end, certainly not enough to release enough spores to saturate the air. Even Jackson has infected around it, and its very far away from water. I agree that the decision to be rid of masks was for creative purposes but I also believe the spores aren‚Äôt enough of a threat to warrant keeping. If its a question of contamination I think the ‚Äútendrils‚Äù can still contaminate food/consumables/potentially clothing, so any of those items coming from areas where tendrils are heavily concentrated would be dangerous to use."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10f4xbn/its_a_welcome_change/,Chavarlison,1 yr. ago,"I've always felt making them(the fungus) spore was a great way to wipe out humanity. You know how pneumonia(or any opportunistic infections) isn't much of a threat but it is deadly to those who are in a weakened state? Same thing will happen to the world on TLoU with those spores. Any elderly would have to be quarantined because they will turn sooner or later with the spores around. The end state for the world of TLoU will be zero settlements with a sporing cordyceps fungus that make it's human migrate around. The only hope would be the discovery of a cure and if Ellie was unique, Joel fucked up the entire human race with that decision."

Haven't seen the new thing in the show yet, so I'm not for nor against the change yet. But I don't think I'll mind it. Don't think only occasional mask wearing would be a big problem, but I can see why they'd want to go for that, yeah.We also never saw the infected moving in high enough numbers together, so we have no reason to believe they would pile up together, die, and start emitting spores as a horde. Living infected evidently don't emit spores. Maybe it's a thing, maybe it isn't, but it wasn't important for the narrative. But it sure would be cool as fuck to have ruined sections of a major city with piles of corpses sprouting up the buildings, and massive clouds of spores fogging up the streets."

Then you got the logistics of air filters for the masks and you might as well just remove it all together.I personally think that the average viewer, or even critics wouldn‚Äôt even notice this hangup and we could‚Äôve still used the masks the same way as the game. It was a great indicator that infected were near and displayed Ellie‚Äôs immunity without a shred of a doubt. As for the not showing actors faces, I think we can go to the Mandalorian as a great example of not needing to see their face while still displayed a wide range of emotions, and theyre mostly see through in TLOU so it wouldn‚Äôt even be that bad."

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10f4xbn/its_a_welcome_change/,Sunjump6,1 yr. ago,I‚Äôm slightly bummed by this because it moved the show closer to the typical zombies we are used to ie. you have to get bit. The spores are a unique twist on the genre. It‚Äôs a minor issue really still loved the episode.
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10f4xbn/its_a_welcome_change/,rynmgdlno,1 yr. ago,"""ie. you have to get bit""This is not true, the first infected we see (old lady neighbor, student in class room with twitchy hand) are never bit. The show may tell us in some hints: (spoiler for those who want to figure it out on their own or wait for the show to state it explicitly if its true)It's (probably) wheat. 1: They show the neighbor literally shoving biscuit crumbs in the old lady's mouth (lol), 2: the other neighbor (daughter of old lady?) is making cookies, 3: Joel says he's on Atkins (possibly just a joke but interesting drop either way). 4: Joel/Sarah are out of pancake mix and he doesnt like pancakes. 5: You could even stretch to say Tommy's infected bar fight is due to wheat (beer). And wheat is the 2nd most consumed crop in the world, so decent explanation for spread."

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/17gnkkz/the_speed_in_this_game_should_be_illegal_lol/,Jackal000,2 mo. ago,"i dont know how you get there tho.If you want to calculate the average speed for a distance of 3250 meters traveled in 1 minute and 40 seconds.Average speed (km/h) = Total distance (km) / Total time (hours)First, you need to convert the time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 1 minute and 40 seconds is equivalent to 1.6667 minutes, which is 0.02778 hours (since 1 minute = 1/60 hours and 40 seconds = 40/3600 hours).Now, you can calculate the average speed:Average speed (km/h) = 3.25 km / 0.02778 hours ‚âà 117.01 km/h or 72 miles per hour for your imperialistsSo, your average speed when traveling 3250 meters in 1 minute and 40 seconds is approximately 117.01 km/h. highway speed in NYC. and top speed is probably much much higher at the start.edit: this only takes in account horizontal velocity. no other axis. like the parabolic maneuvres take out a lot of velocity if he were to travel in a straight line. so top speeds are more like 200 to 300 km/h"

For example, when he dives, he‚Äôs traveling a big distance in a short period of time but it isn‚Äôt registered well because he isn‚Äôt traveling directly toward the objective. Let‚Äôs say he traveled 1.5x the objective distance due to the extra dimension of Spider-man‚Äôs travel. You also said 1.4 minutes but it‚Äôs 1 minute 40 seconds which would be 1.67 minutes.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/17gnkkz/the_speed_in_this_game_should_be_illegal_lol/,DoveTaketh,2 mo. ago,I believe at around the 30 second mark spiderman is flying past the Brooklyn bridge from Financial District into Brooklyn Heights.The bridge spans 1.825km/5989ft and in the video spiderman starts going alongside the bridge at 34 second mark and finishes at around 11-12seconds (in my opinion). This portion does not seem like peak speed but I am unable to find any building or street I could use for reference other than the bridge.It takes spiderman about 22-23 seconds to cover a distance of 1.825km meaning he is going at the potential speeds of 285-299kmh (177-185 mph).With those acceleration speeds he would experience g-forces 4 times higher than a commercial plane during take-off.

After 2 long years of waiting I was finally able to grab one and I was just as excited to get my PS5 as I was when I first got my PS2 when I was kid. The heart racing, the shopping for my first games, the anticipation of playing as it downloads, reading the game descriptions as I wait for my game to start, calling my friends to come over and play (or watch me play lol). It was such a childhood-like memory for me.  I think I even cried.Idc how it seems to other people. Gaming saved me mentally from going down a path no one ever should.

No amount of prayer answers your call, only the ones who show up.This is why I fear religions and ""blessed"" folks.  People pray to God when on their deathbed instead of the ones there trying to save them.To pray for a god who only welcomes you in death always seemed antithetical to me.And religions are usually just a set of rules or morals that really anyone can come to terms with as long as they have the right amount of empathy & understanding.Idk it just seems people don't like to admit they might just need other people in their life. Better people.Maybe ones like those good friends of yours?Anyways not trying to discount your journey I'm sure it wasn't easy as people said, I just hate to see people who experience that then say it was all due to finding God or a religion or whatever when at the end of the day it was the people. The people helped you and they helped you to help yourself. No god or religion truly gives a fuck, only the people."

I stayed positive and spoke positive & thankfully people I‚Äôve also once helped returned that same energy back to me. Doing good to others isn‚Äôt a mystery in religious text, it‚Äôs a revolving of the energy you put out. That‚Äôs why we have to study these so-called religions in their true meaning to properly understand the science behind them.

Too many people are scared to admit that it's people who helped them. Not God or religion. If that's being an atheist then my bad. I just see it as being a realist.People help people. Nothing more nothing less.Wasn't my intent to mock him/her. It was my intent to highlight how them praying or finding God or faith in religion had nothing to do with how at the core of it, those people helped him. It's always people. People have a hard time admitting that they got or needed help. Even if it's just to get to a point where they are able to help themselves.I find it ends up attributing to more problems when people say otherwise that's all. Believe in yourself as much as you believe in others or as much as they believe in you. Reap what you sow.

BUT, these designs are no longer functional as TVs have gone from 28"" CRT to 65""-85"" LED. Like oak entertainment centers, no one wants them anymore. If you look closely, the TV is employing the two legged stand, which I hate, and is terribly non-functional too. Takes almost no effort to move it off of the table, and on the floor. Whoever set this up, sized up the situation and realized it was safer BACKWARDS.  All of my TVs can be put on a stand no wider than 1.5 feet, and will not slide off. Putting this TV on the stand in the proper manner with the curve in the back, forces the TV to be too far out front on the straight edge of the stand. Wedged in a 90 degree corner would help, if having the curve in the back. These tables sold for around $300 and are now being given away or sold for a few dollars, because they aren't large enough to accommodate the cheaper two legged stand on giant TVs, safely. Moving the TV too far forward on the table then makes it a tip over hazard, why, only one flimsy leg needs to hit the edge of the table for it to do a face plant on top of fido or kitty. Manufacturers aren't putting quality stands on TVs anymore, because people toss them and mount the TV on a wall. This is probably the reason he got this table for free or a couple dollars. I'd be forced to mount this on the wall for safer viewing. In CA, an earthquake can send this flipping."

It‚Äôs pretty long so I‚Äôll give you a pretty good summary. I had went back to school for a degree in education, was also diagnosed with agoraphobia, but with online courses and medicine I pushed forward. My grandmother was losing her home, so me and my mother, and my aunt moved in to help her pay the bank back.My aunt eventually got very sick and passed, while sick she also had lost her job and her home too just like my grandmother. So, eventually we all went broke helping pay my grandmother‚Äôs debt & the medical expenses my aunt had and left. Her husband ran off with the money from her insurance, so we all had nothing & nowhere to go. That‚Äôs how I ended up going to the shelter to out in the street. I couldn‚Äôt find work anywhere and for about a few years I had nowhere to go. Friends took me in after awhile and eventually a family friend rented me a house of theirs and helped to provide me a job. I moved my mom in as well and things have looked upwards since."

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/17v12y2/from_being_homeless_sleeping_in_a_chair_to_a_ps5/,Choi_Sarang,2 mo. ago,"For first person I would try out the 2 new Doom games that came out in recent years. Another good one that can get you sucked in for hours on end is Skyrim (you can play this in third person also).For newer third person games I would try final fantasy 16 (and 7 remake), ghost of Tsushima (a game that is so beautiful I would say it rivals the horizon games graphics, if you don‚Äôt believe me look up some screenshots of it online), rdr 1 and 2, Stray ( a game where you play as a cat), demon souls (if you‚Äôre looking for an easier souls like game).

In 1996 Ohio updated their sentencing guidelines but before they passed the new guidelines they first passed a law to prevent petty crimes from resentenced.

The ability to Remote Play stuff like Gravity Rush 2, Horizon Zero Dawn, Genshin Impact, or other games that would stand a good chance of melting even the Switch, much less the 3DS from several states away is just gravy."

I'd bet my life savings they haven't changed a thing about the controller and if my 4 Dualsense with drift are anything to go by this will end up doing the same soon enough.

No.  Do they anyway? Yes.  Is an actual piece of physical tech that lets people play how they want, or maybe can while allowing them to also play while their kids or spouses use the TV worth $200?

Not buying into Steams eco system at $400 with the OLED option at $550.

Lasts like 2-3 hours if you've got headphones in and playing anything that slightly touches haptics.  Honestly love the controller and think it's arguably the best controller there is. But it doesn't compare to the elite v2 in battery terms at all which is the only bad point about it.

It lasts the same amount of time as the fucking Wii U gamepad controller. A controller with a built in screen, a camera, and so many random ass unnecessary add ons, yet. Still gives the same battery life as a modern basic game controller. For a 70$ device you‚Äôd expect to get a quality product. But it‚Äôs quite apparent they didn‚Äôt go for practically and just wanted to sell something ‚Äúunique‚Äù without innovation. Look at the steam deck for example, it incorporates a touch pad which allows for better aiming within games, also incorporating insane levels of customization and gyro support for shooters.

The fact that the ps5 controller is missing any features to enhance the experience beyond a useless touchpad and some slight immersion implementations that no game even utilizes properly is a shame.

In terms of artistic direction and atmosphere it's basically unmatched imo. Its ability to look somewhat realistic and fantastical at once with its rich color pallet and gorgeous skies is genuinely a sight to behold. I honestly don't see how someone could say this, GoT is easily in the top five best looking games on the console. I can't think of many maps as gorgeous and well realized as Tsushima and Iki Island.What games do you think are the best looking?"

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/18rhvac/family_blessed_me_with_a_ps5/,SaikyoWhiteBelt,4 days ago,My daughter got me this for my birthday and I love it! It‚Äôs right next to the ps5 & they look adorable together. Super Mario bros on crack from the first rom page is so much fun! Interesting tech used in this box too as on my 4K flatscreen it displays in proper 16:9 (circles are circles) at 480i. My tv won‚Äôt show 240p. On my retro crt setup it displays at 240p(scan lines no shimmer or flicker) with a proper 4:3 aspect ratio(circles are circles). There isn‚Äôt an option menu or anything to control this. It seems to be auto detecting the display. This shouldn‚Äôt be possible as it‚Äôs only connection option is a mono composite cable but it‚Äôs definitely happening.

Off the top of my head, we have: Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Vudu, Peacock, Max, Apple TV+, Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube Red, and Sony Pictures Core ‚Ä¶ and I bet there are some others I am forgetting or haven‚Äôt even heard of. It sucks."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1782xnb/my_brothers_ps5_setup/,psxndc,3 mo. ago,"The fragmentation was literally what consumers asked for.Everyone was complaining in 2012 because they all subscribed to one cable package with 200 channels they didn‚Äôt watch. Everyone kept saying ‚ÄúI want a smaller, cheaper service with just the content I want to watch.‚Äù So every media company started their own service. Don‚Äôt like Paramount or Disney franchises? Great, you don‚Äôt need to sub to Paramount+ or Disney +.Also, now there‚Äôs no contracts. Only want to watch a few Netflix shows? Sign up for Netflix, binge it, cancel one month later.Sorrynotsorry, but I see these comments all the time, usually followed by ‚ÄúI just want one place where I can watch everything‚Äù which is literally what everyone had ten years ago and complained about."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1782xnb/my_brothers_ps5_setup/,oppairate,3 mo. ago,"i don‚Äôt think the idea of a la carte cable packaging is really analogous to the current issue of streaming fragmentation. before i fully understood what was owned by who and how some (typically more niche) content is subsidized by other, more popular content i really wanted just X, Y, and Z channels. even then, it‚Äôs not like i wanted everything on those channels. but never once has the idea of ‚Äúi really just like Paramount content‚Äù on the whole ever been a thing. Disney maybe, but not Paramount, Peacock, or even what Max is now, so now i still have to subscribe to a ton of trash i don‚Äôt want just to get at the specific content i do want, typically at the cost of that old 200+ channel cable package. people wanted stuff broken up in a way that they could easily just subscribe to what they actually want to watch, but that would kill so much unique content that doesn‚Äôt necessarily have the mass appeal to sustain itself. so now, because the larger media conglomerates felt like they were leaving money on the table during the brief heyday when pretty much everything was consolidated among Netflix and Hulu, we‚Äôre back to essentially the same model as cable, except now you see why the content groupings are what they are (IP ownership) instead of that being hidden by merit of the deals your cable provider was making."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1782xnb/my_brothers_ps5_setup/,psxndc,3 mo. ago,"The problem is the economics of making content. It is *absurdly* expensive to do so - look at Disney and Max cutting shows to save on royalties or Netflix's infamous ""we'll do the first three seasons for cheap and cancel you after three to avoid the financial hit."" Basically there is very little content out there that economically works, so they jack up the price of what does work so that other content gets made. But the cracks are starting to show, which is why they either glom together under a single entity or you have a company like Disney shopping around for partners for ESPN or buyers for ABC.If you're talking about wanting the ability to buy just individual shows, they have that (iTunes did/does it, BestBuy sells seasons and box sets) and it doesn't sell from what my friends at the studios tell me."

Everything about it is so well crafted, even the music is incredible. I highly recommend. Also, it‚Äôs like a tour through PlayStations history. The collectibles are all the consoles, handhelds and accessories going all the way back to PS1. It‚Äôs a good time"
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/17797o5/im_scared_guys_what_does_this_mean/,TwoGlassEyes,3 mo. ago,"+1 to this.  Perfect dual stick game for young kids to learn to play through as well.  There is a solid time trial mode, so you can have a challenge if you like.  It's a good game for making a bit of your own fun as well, yet linear and varied enough to stay engaging.  There are some pretty good boss battles for the type of game it is.  It shows off the features of the PS5 controller in a way that doesn't feel like a gimmick."

My daughter was 5 when she completed it for the first time!  I had to assist with a few tricky sections that she has since mastered.  It is very much a 'go at your own pace' type game, aside from the few tricky sections.  Kirby and the Forgotten Land is another stellar intro game that has a good bit of depth and challenge if you seek it out (and have a switch).  That was my sons first real game at around 3-4 and it has local co-op!"

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1015vdo/hey_guys_is_this_spot_okay_for_my_ps5/,zumabbar,1 yr. ago,"i think anything more than 2 inches doesnt have any effect anymore for PS5, even in horizontal position. iirc the console's body temp wont be that high to result in such a wide thermal plume. in horizontal, well if you use the stand, the clearance is already enough for unrestricted intake's flow, its rate is not that big.edit: if it's above another electronical device, it would depend on how hot its surfaces get, not to mention any hot exhaust air it produces. it'd say as long as you make sure the exhaust air isnt directed at the other consoles' intake sides, any distance is suffice. a wire rack is def better since the heat plume would get more dispersed/spread out, reducing any local higher temperature. im not sure how much better, but i dont think good enough to sacrifice a solid base for the console/its stand and anything else."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1015vdo/hey_guys_is_this_spot_okay_for_my_ps5/,trailmixjesus,1 yr. ago,The exhaust is usually my main concern and the ps5 kicks some exhaust lol I have mine kiddie cornered on my stand with the corner of the wall with the smallest distance being maybe 8 inches and the entire area behind the ps5 gets warm. I know that much space is a little overkill but in my mind it makes me feel better with how the whole space behind it gets that warm.
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1015vdo/hey_guys_is_this_spot_okay_for_my_ps5/,zumabbar,1 yr. ago,"oh that's definitely sufficient. the farther the better, it could prevent backflows from exhaust to the intake. since the exhaust is hot enough to be sensed by your skin, try to feel the air arounds the top of the console to see if there's any backflows. could be handy (yes, pun intended) if you ever have to move your console closer to the wall."

The files are just locked unless you buy the game for real or insert a disc.This means that if the disc is intact enough to be recognized as a valid license, but too damaged to perform a full install, you can just use the aforementioned method to install the game digitally, and then unlock it with your damaged disc.It's also a time saver if you've ordered a physical game online.

If he makes 100TL/month at the time he subbed, and paid 10TL per year for PSN and stacked x20yrs, then he paid 200TL or 2 months wages, but 1yr PSN = 10% of 1 months wages.If inflation means PSN next year is 200TL/yr (x20 price, won't happen, unless hyperinflation, but example) then yes, he basically paid 20yrs with next yrs sub price. If wage growth matches inflation, then he will earn 100 x20 = 2000TL/month and PSN at 200TL/yr still means 1yr PSN = 10% of 1 months wages.The scenario he wins in is inflation (specifically of PSN sub, not national inflation) outstrips wage inflation, e.g. next year PSN goes +20% to 12TL/yr but wage only goes +10% to 110TL/m."

They did a bad thing but people getting so irate about such minor things that they wish extremely bad outcomes for them really bothers me. It's such a cavalierly punitive attitude. You see all the time where minor crimes get comments like ""lock them up and throw away the key"", ""give them the death penalty"" etc. The internet has such a perversely barbaric attitude towards minor grievances and a total lack of proportionality.But in the end, it's this: it's just a throwaway comment.

They say something and then forget about the guy seconds after they said it.I see comments like those I replied toall the time. That's my issue. I make no apologies for trying to bring to people's attention how disproportionate their mob mentality is. This person bought a few items that weren't being produced in enough volumes and was hoping to resell them to pay off their tuition fees and people want him to fail at life? What they did wasn't commendable but everyone has done less than stellar things in their lives just as bad if not worse. Wishing such profoundly life destroying outcomes on people at the drop of a hat is just one facet of the pervasive negativity and hostility that exists all over the internet.The commenter may immediately forget about it but very often when singled out the people (especially if named and photographed) who get this harassment have to deal with thousands of comments wishing ill on them.

I'd say a good number of people haven't actively done things that screws other people over for a selfish goal. But lots of people have. That brings me to a different topic: people don't care about other people's lives. Your sympathy for this person is exceptional. In general, people don't care if you live or die. That said, why does it matter if you want someone's life to fail? It's just a life. It's unimportant in the grand scheme of things. And you're surrounded by people who disregard lives on a daily basis. That's what I see all the time.Honestly, I feel like you're right. I really do. If we had more people like you, maybe things would be better. Maybe you're just a better person than me, I dunno. Maybe I need to lie down and rethink my outlook on life.

I think owning the Portal until 2.0 comes out is the way to go (if you're a primary PS gamer)"

These are things that will likely be experimented with by other companies at higher price points (Lenovo Go, Rog Ally etc) and then used in a more mature state in the inevitable Steam Deck 2 in like 2 or 3 years."

The bigger the screen, the more pixels we need for density. I'm okay with the 800p, but I'd like it to go full or near edge-to-edge display which means more pixels for me. Me no like bezels.I do agree that some things could be improved, but all those things today would push the price to over $1000 which makes its whole existence pointlessThe priciest feature request I have is the GPU / CPU upgrade and the bigger screen both which will come down in price with time. The cost of those other things will go down as technology progresses as well.If they iterate like they did with this OLED release (shrink internals, update battery) but couple it with an ergonomic update that shrinks it making it less square and more friendly on the hands while also cutting back on materials used, then I think it could be released at or near the same price as the current version."

Bought because I can still play whilst my Mrs watches something on the TV or I just want play some in bed when I wake up on my days off.I was slightly apprehensive as I've never found remote play through my phone to be that great. Tried with on screen controls and with an actual controller and always had some noticeable input lag in games putting me off using it for anything other than basic admin tasks on games.I get that everyone's experience with remote play differs but this is just my experience. So far it has exceeded expectations. Input lag basically non existent in various rooms around the house. Playstation is hard wired to the router. Swing about in spider man and did some strikes in destiny. Screen looked crisp (8"" screen is plenty big enough and still looks great for an LCD) and had no stuttering or lag at all to the point where it felt like playing natively. Possible benefit of a custom device for a single task rather than having 100 background stuff going on like my phone.For anyone saying you can get the exact same experience for cheaper, I would massively disagree from my experience anyway. It is a much more elegant and better integrated use of remote play and feels so much nicer to do actual gaming with. No hassle of setup. Just turn it on and press connect. For ¬£200 it was never going to play games natively and the most recent news that cloud gaming is being looked at would add another dimension.Very happy with my purchase so far."

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/17vrrda/happy_playstation_portal_launch_day/,jeanswithotherjeans,1 mo. ago,"Hi all,I just got my ps portal and here are my quick opinions.I have good internet at home, playstation 5 is plugged in with ethernet cable.I tried Baulders Gate 3, Spiderman Miles Morales, Crash team racing: Nitro fueled, and Red Dead Redemption 2.All of the above do well with HDR turned off or in performance mode (don't see a visual downgrade on the portal as it plays in 1080 p anyways).The screen is nicer than my original Nintendo switch by quite a bit.  Nice size and decent colour feel.Initial setup was fast using QR code to connect to playstation account (other than needing to update out of the box).Input lag seems negligible to me.  It's a touch less peppy than on my TV maybe, but miles better than my attempts at using my laptop for remote play or my Samsung galaxy s10 (both were fairly unpleasant for me to use for remote play: resolution issues, bad input lag etc).I'm not sure I would use this for online competitive fps games, but for all of my single player games that I am working through, I feel confident in enjoying the handheld experience.For me, I use my Nintendo Switch almost exclusively handheld.  And the visuals on the portal feel nearly as good as when using our 4k HDR Sony television.I'll update this if I have any negative experiences, this is super preliminary, but for me as a big handheld person, I  am happy with the purchase so far.Also the speakers are decent for what they are (my over ear Bluetooth headphones have a wire option, so I will use that when I want proper sound).Cheers, everyone!Edit: spelling, clarified a couple things"

If I recall correctly, the GameCube was supposedly the most technically capable of it's generation, but the Xbox and Playstation 2 did have some stunningly beautiful masterpieces. GameCube games leaned into the cel shading and cartoony graphics a lot, but that doesn't mean the console couldn't handle it.  (And then we got the Wii, which was not any more graphically capable than GameCube and they've never caught back up to to the current Gen competition.)In my case, the Nintendo consoles are usually launch day pickups if possible, just like the Xbox and Playstation machines. I love 4k60 or even high refresh rate gaming, but Nintendo always has some games up their sleeve that pulls me in. For example, when Breath of the Wild launched with the Switch I couldn't put it down for a few weeks.Out of curiosity, what types of games are your favorites?

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/13r9y6t/look_guys_its_project_q/,TemporaryDrink3692,7 mo. ago,What is the difference between 4k60 and high Refresh rate games? Just found it weird that you specified high refresh rate games.. Seeing as how that is a spec on your Phone/TV/Monitor and not the game or console themselves..
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/13r9y6t/look_guys_its_project_q/,s0nicpr0s,7 mo. ago,"That is a fair question. I probably could have worded my response differently to be a little clearer The difference between those is that 60 frames per second is not the limit for some hardware or software. With this current generation of consoles from Microsoft and Sony, many games offer the user a choice on performance profiles. You may turn on/off features such as ray tracing, adjust the graphical fidelity, or remove the frame rate limiter.For example on PlayStation, the God of War Ragnarok, Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart, and the Marvel's Spider-Man games each give you three general modes to choose from: Resolution, Performance, and Performance RT. This won't apply to each game but that generally sums up to be the following: targeting 4k30 for resolution mode, and anywhere from 30 to 120 frames per second at a resolution between 1440p and 1080p for the performance modes.One of the other options supported by some games include Variable Refresh Rates. This tech allows the display to update the picture as soon as it's received instead of waiting until the next scheduled refresh. Instead of a locked 30 or 60 updates per second, it can change freely between a range of speeds.  By combining one of the Performance modes with VRR, I have played some of these games at greater than 60 frames per second.You are correct that the hardware needs to support these features, but it needs to be supported by the game and console as well. If the TV supports a feature like 120Hz refresh but your game/console doesn't, that feature will not be used. The reverse is also true, if your game/console is capable of outputting a 4k image and you're using a 1080p display, you'll be limited to a 1080p image. (Downscaling does exist, but I can't say I've personally experienced this on a console, only on PC). I happen to be using a display that supports up to 4k120 with VRR, so I'm able to tweak many games to my preferences. I am aware that not everyone has had the opportunity or desire to do the same."

So that means it should probably be like 150-175$. But since this is PlayStation/Sony and they always overprice all their products, 200$ sounds about right. Anything higher than that will pretty much kill the sales for a device that's strictly only for streaming Playstation games from your own console (no mention of even streaming from the cloud, which should be a required feature to bring value to a device like this).Now, if they are feeling really confident, it wouldn't be completely impossible for them to ask up to $250, but without cloud streaming support (so you don't need a ps5) I think it would be difficult for even a big gaming fan to spend that much on this. At that point a gamer would start looking at a Steam Deck, which starts at 400$ without any sale, but is able to play a large library of PC games natively without streaming."

My major concern is if they cut corners again with the technology on the thumb sticks which is prone to drift over time.

Why on earth would you pay 200$ for such a device (I doubt it's going to be cheap) when you can just use the app on your phone or tablet?

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/112q7xc/what_is_playstations_big_three_franchises/,Ttrpgdaddy,11 mo. ago,"I would argue that brand recognition, low price point, and excellent marketing won Europe the same way it won the U.S. - the console launch was a resounding success and even though Gran Turismo was wildly popular, if it never existed it‚Äôs not like Saturn or another console  would have won out. Sega bungled its launch and Atari Jaguar was nothing. There wasn‚Äôt much competition outside of N64. GT would have had to be responsible for for 85%+ of PlayStation's sales to say it singlehandedly won Europe. It sold 14 million copies in the EU which is a shit load, almost as much as the U.S. but that is way less than consoles were bought.It‚Äôs the most popular game but that‚Äôs also like saying ‚ÄúMario 64 was responsible for the N64s success.‚Äù When there were plenty of reasons to buy one outside of a single title. If you had to hand the success of Playstation to one game, yes, it was inarguably GT."

And both games came with licensed soundtracks that made the charts, featuring tracks from Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy, Orbital, New Order (remixed by Hardfloor), Underworld, Fluke and Future Sound of London.Psygnosis' Wipeout in particular became associated with nightclub culture as it was widely featured in venues.[115][117] By 1997, there were 52 nightclubs in the United Kingdom with dedicated PlayStation rooms. Glendenning recalled that he had discreetly used at least ¬£100,000 a year in slush fund money to invest in impromptu marketing.[114]Their whole marketing scheme was absolutely insane here in the UK, was before my time but my older cousins tell me about it a lot.Sony dominated the home consoles here, the PS1 outsold the Saturn many times over."

While XBOX and Nintendo focus on cultivating their headline franchises and make sequel and spin-off to no end, Sony goes for diversity. There‚Äôs Uncharted - but it‚Äôs finished. There‚Äôs only really two Last of Us‚Äôs and God of Wars. LBP and Sly Cooper have been stagnant. GoT, Until Dawn, and Bloodborne are iconic singular games; there‚Äôs so much diversity and not much stability.Sony ends a franchise when it‚Äôs done and is open to more and more - XBOX and Nintendo are content focusing on what they‚Äôve made successful from relying on it for decades."
