https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18kl1s2/everyone_laugh_at_the_idiot_on_ebay_lmao/,Ramenshark1,13 days ago,I agree to not get emotional about itbut That's not a reason to not speak up about it. The more you denounce and announce the less people will give in to the scalpers which means scalping stops somewhere down the line. I think its great to have many people talk about why it's not worth it and really ridiculous to buy from a scalper!

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18kl1s2/everyone_laugh_at_the_idiot_on_ebay_lmao/,rdizzy1223,13 days ago,"Stores and the corporations making the products could stomp them out really quickly, with over production of the initial product to limit shortages, and stores having very very short return times on expensive electronics. Then the scalpers would either A. Not bother to begin with (which is a huge plus), or B. Get stuck with something they don't want and have so many and so much money locked up in them that they have to sell at a loss.Most of these product shortages aren't even caused by consumers buying the products to use, they are caused by scalpers, on purpose."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18kl1s2/everyone_laugh_at_the_idiot_on_ebay_lmao/,NotoriousWhiz,11 days ago,Not warranty. Return. Big difference. Warranty implies something is wrong with the product and that should be unchanged.

Just ask the scalpers who had to figure out how to unload 40 PS5‚Äôs after Sony dropped the 1200 series model. I waited two years but I was finally able to get a fuckin PlayStation at MSRP. And I LAUGHED at all the scalpers posting in my game groups selling PlayStations at fifty under msrp to try and recoup SOME of their money.There‚Äôs tons of risk.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18kl1s2/everyone_laugh_at_the_idiot_on_ebay_lmao/,KrisTheHuman,10 days ago,"If they were buying 40 PS5's at once then clearly there's plenty of supply and not enough demand. Sure, there is a certain amount of risk if they aren't doing their due diligence and assessing the market.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18kl1s2/everyone_laugh_at_the_idiot_on_ebay_lmao/,msihcs,13 days ago,"There are benefits to renting vs owning. People dip out on a lease and it doesn't cost them shit in the long term. People dip out on a mortgage though, that can cause a lifetime of credit problems. People may prefer to rent because they don't want to be tied to one place for life. Or they may prefer to rent because they don't want to be responsible for upkeep when something happens to said rental property.The point is, landlords aren't all bad. They do charge a little more than a mortgage, but they're also holding all the cards. They're assuming all the risk. Renters have almost zero liability."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18kl1s2/everyone_laugh_at_the_idiot_on_ebay_lmao/,Changalator,12 days ago,"Here‚Äôs some food for thought buddy.  If landlords profit without giving any other benefit, why would there even be a market for rent?  I, along with many of my friends, have or currently renting because there is significant benefits. Cheaper compared to a mortgage, landlord handles fixes, landlord handles the property tax, not having to worry about upkeep, and etc.  It‚Äôs for this very reason why renting is a viable stepping stone until you are ready financially to own your own house.  Not sure what kind of slumlords you personally dealt with, but a professional landlord does provide benefits."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18kl1s2/everyone_laugh_at_the_idiot_on_ebay_lmao/,Changalator,12 days ago,"Nice of you to ignore all my other points but you seem adamant on painting all landlords a certain color so you do you.  And no, I used to rent in a time of my life where I wanted no further obligation besides paying a set rent that I am comfortable with until I figure out where I want to settle long term.  At that time, I do not want to take on a mortgage and get stuck with a house that I will have to upkeep in an area I wasn‚Äôt sure I will be long term.  Hence, the value of renting was quite apparent.  Fast forward years after, I transition to home ownership cause I am in a different stage of my life where it makes sense to own rather than rent.  Nothing is so black and white like how you wanna paint it."

Obviously the Portal was a different situation to the PS5 because the Portal was readily available for many weeks up until launch when it finally became hard to find one. However, to simply say ‚Äúpreorder a PS6‚Äù and all your problems will go away is being naive. I preordered a PS5 and was damn lucky to get one on launch day. However, I had to shop for about 3 hours on 4 different devices browsing multiple different shops at the same time because the second I would add it to my cart, it would go out of stock. I missed on every single major retailer due to sites crashing or selling out from bots before I could complete the checkout process. The only way I managed to get one at launch was someone leaked an Amazon link that was not live on the site but only worked if you had the link. Otherwise I would not have gotten a PS5 for many months.

Give or take 2-3 months from now, the novelty is going to wear out. Just do Chiaki for now those who have Steam deck. It works just as well if not a bit better around the house.

A device that's basically a controller and a screen to play games you've already got the console, controller and games that is required to play it anyway. Rather than buying these from Ebay at inflated prices, I know it's not the same but if you need a second screen desperately while the wife and kids use the TV buy a cheap monitor and get a portal from the store whenever  they are readily available. Can't understand at all how this has become a must have FOMO item really. I'd get it if you were desperate to play a release title that was exclusive to the portal but given its not even able to play solitaire on its own and folks have already got the ps5 and games to play on their massive screens it's mind boggling the enthusiasm for this. All the ""my wife likes me to play games in bed next to her"" and ""dadstation"" posts that I'm seeing while the kids are in the background watching paw patrol. Each to their own and as a dad myself with limited time I can understand that appeal for squeezing in more gaming time but what's essentially a screen and a controller is probably the least exciting hardware release I've seen in gaming in the past 30 odd years. That said,  if folk are buying these from scalpers then these guys could probably sell ice to the Eskimos too."

It uses your cell phone to play games. Both xbox and PlayStation plus steam. Looks similar to the portal. And it has bluetooth plus a 3.5mm plug in for headphones. I use an iphone and can any headphones i wish. Portal requires you to buy their setup for an additional $199. Now tell me in replies why the portal is better than the backbone. Plays same games off playstation 4 and 5.

With iPhone, I  used Razer Kishi v.1 until the left side suddenly stopped working. Been using wife‚Äôs Backbone since then with thumb grips since the analogs are too stubby and sensitive without. Also have PSplay on my iPad to play in bed using DualSense. iPad is held by a gooseneck mount to be able to position it at eye level.PSPlay is sooooo much better than the native Remote Play app. If your internet is up to par, everything is crisp and smooth with no lag. I play COD online sometimes and it works fine but lately have been playing mostly one player games and it works great. My only complaint is that I used to be able to get it to work while not on the same network but after upgrading my set up with mesh system, it hasn‚Äôt been working outside my home. Beforehand when it did, it even worked great then with little to no lag despite not being on the same network.I always had problems with the Remote Play app being too grainy or with lag whether on the same network or not. The only time it seems to work well is using Remote Play app on my laptop. But on a mobile device it was just too frustrating and low quality of an experience to even enjoy it.Although I was excited for the Portal, I think I‚Äôm going to stick with my current setup since it works so well.  Nothing beats having the iPad floating in front of you at eye level and playing with an actual DualSense while laying in bed."

I moved my PS4 up there and in theory wanted to take that space to clear up the backlog - but tbh, I haven't touched the PS4 since I got the 5. My bedroom has a nice TV, but not PS5 nice and the Mrs is pretty much anti light/noise when she's gearing up for bedSo bottom line, I can hang out with the kiddos and chill and let them have the TV do watch whatever and if say my daughter wants to watch another K-Drama with the same plot for the 1000 time, I can peacefully play on the Portal and still be present with them"

Hotel wifi is hit or miss.  I've been streaming with a Logitech GCloud for about a year and now this. Just try to plan to stay places with reasonable wifi. If not get a steamdeck or ROG Ally.

We don't need this hammered so much.  We don't all want steamdecks.  I don't play pc games.  And ps5 games on my portal will look miles better than native steamdeck games.  BG3 looks miserable on steamdeck compared to how it looks on portal from ps5.

So really it‚Äôs $300-400 for the system.It‚Äôs not under rated, it works well when it does.  It‚Äôs just an interesting price point."

I‚Äôm currently visiting family for Christmas. I don‚Äôt want to have to lug my ps5 half way around the country.I also have a lot of downtime at work. I can make a lot of headway into my backed up catalogue of games with this.I‚Äôm not interested in 3rd party remote play options. I tried using a ps5 controller and the remote play app on my pc. It was horrible. Lots of lag and interrupted connection every 30 seconds. Having a dedicated device for remote play by the same company that makes the ps5 has been great!

Hell I won't even settle for WiFi lol üí©. It's hardwire 100% for me so I'm one of these peopleDo you watch all you movies on it too? If not why? That most likely be the answer why others prefer gaming on a big tv vs small hand held. If the answer is yes then it's a matter of not settling for less/smaller screen. I couldn't imagine a scenario where I would choose to watch or play something on a 10 in screen vs a 75in screen.So mainly a combo of those two things is why if you ask me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

This can vary on many factors on the type of phones out there. Though in my experience on a iPhone 15PM with the backbone usb c. The portal will absolutely obliterate the cellphone + backbone in overall experience. The adaptive triggers and vibrations being extra immersion that the backbone cannot. Also sizing is a big factor your hands are constraint holding the backbone. While portal you got a full hand grip.I highly recommend Portal for the PS5 on go. It can be better but I truly enjoy it to recommend it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18mvrte/already_got_one_preowned_at_gamestop/,4gotAboutDre,9 days ago,"20+ years ago as a college student, I worked at a gamestop and the return policy was absolutely a joke. We gave people a certain amount of time to return a brand new game (don‚Äôt recall exactly how ling it was) but if a game was returned after being played, it was re-shrink wrapped in the back room and put back on the shelf as ‚Äúnew‚Äù not ‚Äúused‚Äù but you could always tell which games were actually new and which had been re-wrapped. That policy eventually changed for obvious reasons but it was in place for years. On top of that, you have the same situation as this post‚Äôs photo. Things that were fairly new but used would only be $5 to $10 cheaper than new and as others have pointed out, it is less risky to buy new and have the manufacturer‚Äôs warranty vs. the gamestop return policy as your only protection. It is a wonder to me how this place has even stayed in business so long.Edit to add: the week before I actually left the company, they pulled us all into a meeting to say that paychecks were going away and being replaced by prepaid visa cards that our pay would be added to every two weeks but they had fees for everything from withdrawals to being used in any regular store. Direct deposit was still an option, but it was just such a weird way to pivot for paying your employees for such a big corporation."

We all knew.This is just a way better and way more convenient option than lugging multiple devices(tablet or phone and controller and whatever device to clasp them together) around. This also doesn‚Äôt burn the battery of my phone or require me to deal with notifications from a phone or tablet popping up in my face while I play, or missing notifications because they are turned off. I use my phone for life, not gaming. The portal is convenient as fuck and I get why some like you will sit back and hate on it, because yeah there have been other options to accomplish this for years and years. We‚Äôre not dumb(most of us anyway) this is just super easy and way more convenient. So for a normal adult with a regular successful life, $199 extra for this kind of convenience isn‚Äôt a problem. So I‚Äôm sorry if you‚Äôre struggling(maybe, I don‚Äôt know) or can‚Äôt make an extra couple hundred bucks work, but don‚Äôt waste your time hating on those that can. All you‚Äôre gonna do is make yourself bitter and upset at people who don‚Äôt care that you dislike them.

Gaming ,even over good wifi, to a home console does not work well enough to even come close to playing it locally, and everyone‚Äôs in denial.

For yourself and others it may not be a viable option but for others it is. PlayStation is known for its catalog of excellent quality single player games so for most PS5 owners it will benefit them if they play those games exclusively. Others that play lots of online multiplayer games may want to pass on this as well because it won‚Äôt meet those needs.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18sdyxv/visiting_home_for_christmas_while_the_ps5_is_back/,Masenko-beams,3 days ago,I truly believe Sony is just testing waters with the portal and judging by the reception it‚Äôs gotten so far they very well might take over the handheld market soon with a cloud upgrade or brand new device altogether.

Of course, it all depends on how your remote play experience currently. I had a good experience with chiaki on steam deck but it would flicker at times, I wish the screen was better, and you can only use chiaki on your home network unless you do a bunch of port forwarding on your router to use it outside of your house. Screen on this is really good for LCD, colors pop really well. Device is VERY comfortable. I think it‚Äôs more comfortable than the Steam Deck and WAY more comfortable than the ROG Ally. I played Spiderman and had very minimal delay. Loved having the haptics in the palm of my hand again. If you have solid remote play currently, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I love having one device just devoted to PlayStation remote play unlike using a backbone or anything. Will test how this thing is outside of home but I will mainly use it at home while chilling with the wife on the couch after we have been with our son all day."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17p8716/playstation_portal_looking_good/,texxmix,2 mo. ago,Tbf remote play is only capable of outputting 1080p at the moment. Also not sure if it‚Äôs true or not but at a small screen size like that it‚Äôs much harder for your average user to notice the quality difference. This is partially why the steam deck is 720P.If anything a Oled screen capable of hdr even at 1080 would be better than a 4K screen of this size should come first imo. My only real complaint. But I can see why they probably went with just a 1080 lcd to save on battery

I was going to buy it until I thought about how I‚Äôd actually use it. I got a cat who will leave cables alone but she will gnaw on cords if I‚Äôm in bed with her. Wireless audio is a complete must, and I‚Äôve already got expensive wireless headphones. At the end of the day, I‚Äôm very annoyed that they didn‚Äôt work out a reasonable wireless audio solution for the device. One that doesn‚Äôt involve sinking another $150-200 into wireless audio for the Portal for new headphones that might or might not be comfortable. The last gaming wireless headphones from Sony were not comfortable at all for me.If they just let me pair my existing Bose or Beats headphones, with the understanding that they‚Äôd have some latency, I‚Äôd have gladly kept my preorder. Instead, I decided to give Remote Play on my MacBook an honest try and realized it was basically good enough and I could use my wireless headphones with it. And the funny thing is the latency is just fine with my wireless headphones for the kind of games I play. Remote Play is weirdly bad with some games (Resident Evil 5) but quite good with most.I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm unreasonable for wishing that the PS Portal could do at least what the Remote Play on my Apple devices can do. As in I wish that it could dock to a monitor and that it could support Bluetooth audio. But the docking to a monitor is a wishlist. Lack of Bluetooth audio is a legit dealbreaker."

And the games they do share aren't very high demanding of resources.  You can barely run Skyrim on a switch which is over a decade old as a game.  They just don't have the specs.Also there are a lot of games that literally can't be ported to switch that runs on other systems due to it's limitations. Any demanding ones they do port over come with reduced graphics / ok there things.Switches are cheap for a reason is what I'm saying.  They are a glorified Android phone with joycons.  It would not be a similar experience to playing full next gen console games on the portal.  Completely different use cases.

Now take your criticism of the Switch as ""android phone with joycons"" and apply it to PS Portal. At the very least Switch has functionality as a console, while the PS Portal is literally just a screen with a controller attached. They don't have different use cases whatsoever, you're just saying the Portal looks better doing the exact same thing the Switch does."

If I was still using consoles as one of my daily gaming machines I would absolutely be buying a portal and it's not a pointless device at all.  If you've ever tried to remote play through a tablet it's shit.  The latency sucks, the artifacting is non-stop, and it's just a bad experience.  From what I've heard and read, the portal negates the issues with remote streaming to an impressive degree.  I've never had good luck with streaming, not moonlight, none of it, so if this device actually worked well to stream the ps5?  gamechanger for those who have a ps5.  The deck/ally/go are great options for purely portable handheld gaming devices but they aren't playstations.  they are not easy to set up or use.  nor are they easy to troubleshoot.  you need a fairly comprehensive knowledge of windows and pcs to use them to their fullest.  This?  sounds like it's pretty plug and play so it's a great stepping stone into the fully handheld pc market for console gamers.  That's where Asus fucked up, they marketed the Ally as a portable console that can play ""allyourgames"" but really it needed to be marketed as a handheld laptop vs a handheld console."

If it actually had games that would be awesome, or if you could use it like a wii u gamepad and have inventory and other things on it that would be sick, but for what it is, a device thats sole purpose is to be a device tethered to the internet, it doesnt fit any spot in the market, which sucks HARD, sony has made incredible handhelds in the past and it feels like they gave up with this one just so that they could keep something in the handheld area.

Should people go out and buy a $1400 folding smartphone instead of a $200 purpose built device?

That is such a dumb argument.And sure HDR and WiFi 6E would be great, but they would also likely increase the cost.Also, remote play doesn't support 120hz no matter what device you play on."

No bluetooth. Oh well. Buy our proprietary earbuds and headset that works out of the box with the Portal. Sony doesn‚Äôt care if they are making huge leaps in market share. Most that would criticize the perceived lack of features on the Portal are simply not the target audience. After all, it‚Äôs simply a $200 dollar PS5 remote play controller with an above average lcd screen. They have their dedicated base and continue delivering products that they will purchase. Simple as that.Disclaimer - This is only my opinion."

Finally grabbed a pair yesterday (haven't shipped yet) after deciding that a pair of dedicated in-ears for gaming makes sense and the reports of ""muted"" audio are (hopefully) folks coming from a bass heavy Turtle Beach or something, and not folks with an ear for specifics Which is fine!

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18585pc/3d_printed_playstation_portal_stand/,Dukefenix,1 mo. ago,"So when docking you will need to pull the cable through the station, connect it to your device then dock your device on the stand.

The problem is people like you. There is no right way to use bots. They have systematically made things worse for anyone who does online purchases and sometimes even in stores. Just because they‚Äôve had it for years doesn‚Äôt suddenly make it okay. ALL bots are scummy. It doesn‚Äôt help people like you justifying it or companies allowing them to run rampant instead of forcing people to use identification when purchasing or other lockouts.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18c4j76/dadstation_complete/,iheartzombi3s,24 days ago,Be honest..how‚Äôs the audio quality? Do you feel it‚Äôs worth the 200 price point?
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18c4j76/dadstation_complete/,tylerdurdenUTFR,24 days ago,Nope. It‚Äôs good sure but I‚Äôll keep my AirPods over this for general use tbh.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18c4j76/dadstation_complete/,teal_ninja,24 days ago,"Yes, but regular AirPods cannot be used with the portal, correct? I think it‚Äôs only things that have the pulse technology in them. Hence, why you have to buy a pulse headset or pulse earbuds"

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18c4j76/dadstation_complete/,iheartzombi3s,23 days ago,I mean you Can.. you‚Äôve just got to attach a Bluetooth dongle which is preposterous especially since the chipset inside of the portal allows Bluetooth connectivity.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18c4j76/dadstation_complete/,SnooPeripherals1478,24 days ago,I think they are worth it. Convenience of wireless is huge and they are at or beyond the level of my sennheiser pc38x and hd 58x that I run off a schitt hel. Clarity on the explorers is awesome.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/189w8pn/stay_strong_peeps/,TheDopeOne463,27 days ago,"I was using HotStock app with the autobuy. In my experience though the autobuy function wasn‚Äôt really worth it. I‚Äôve been trying to get one since release date and it‚Äôs been just constant headaches.I set up all my login info for every site they supported, set up the 2fa for Best Buy using the HotStock app, cleared all remembered and trusted devices from Best Buy, even deleted the bb app on my phone so the only thing would come up would be through HotStock.I would still get asked to manually log in, asked for verification codes, and a bunch of other nonsense. Even this morning when I did get one I had to log in, enter the cvv and get a code from my cc company for it to go in. Surprisingly it went through and I was able to purchase.Other people have had better success with autobuy in HotStock, claiming they leave the app open over night and it would just buy it for them no extra work required. In my case, the only thing it did was load up the Best Buy site for me, so I was always having to be constantly aware whenever a notification hit. YMMV though."

The closest Targets to me are 30 and 45 mins away and they won‚Äôt tell me about how much stock they have over the phone.I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs worth just showing up and asking but that kills a couple hours of my Sunday driving and potentially just wasting time.

I binged a few games with my wife she loved sackboy, and I could get away with playing Uncharted on the family room tv because she loved the story. Playing other games like destiny 2 and especially GT7, I had to move to the basement, she had no desire to watch me race for hours. With the release of TOTK I was back up on the couch again, and good thing with a newborn on the way.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/188kc8r/i_bought_a_bunch_of_stands_so_you_wouldnt_have_to/,4paul,1 mo. ago,"8/10.HumanCentric($40).  This one looks the nicest with the wood finish, has a soft interior so it doesn‚Äôt scratch, only downside is it covers the screen (which technically doesn‚Äôt matter since you wouldn‚Äôt be using it on the stand). But to some that might be a big deal.7/10.Macally($25). This one has potential to be an actual charger. I‚Äôm going to fiddle around and see if I can easily put a magnetic USB charger inside so I can simply place it in the stand and it just automatically charges. That‚Äôs technically my goal in getting all these stands, is how can I implement magnetic charging. Also it‚Äôs adjustable an inch, give or take! If I can make it a charger, this is easily a 9/10.7/10.Psitek($18). This stand is sturdy and is adjustable too and soft on the inside, downside is SOMETIMES the wall of the stand touches the screen (it‚Äôs soft so doesn‚Äôt scratch) but it enters buttons when you place it in the stand (sometimes, I‚Äôd say like 1 out of 10 times). Not a big deal though.5/10.Vaydeer($13). This is by far the cheapest looking and feeling stand, very plastic, but it‚Äôs adjustable which is nice. Also it has an extra slot for a phone or any square shaped tech like a phone that needs a stand. If you just need a cheap stand, and don‚Äôt mind it looking cheap, this is perfect for $13.8/10.Satachi($40). This is actually my favorite. It‚Äôs soft on the inside, very hard on the outside (like steel), made by Satachi (good brand imo) and I have already used this for my iPhone and iPad and Apple Pencil (in the front). It‚Äôs also very very small and low profile which is nice. This would be my pick if I just wanted a stand, but I‚Äôm looking to turn one of these into a charger and this one won‚Äôt do.4/10.HumanCentric($35). It looks premium, metal-like material on the outside and soft/rubber on the inside, only reason for the low score is because it doesn‚Äôt hold the Portal properly due to the Portals back. It works, but it‚Äôs a little finicky.Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for a premium look, #1 is the best. If you want something smaller that doesn‚Äôt hide the screen and can hold another device (phone/tablet/etc) #5 is my next recommendation. Lastly although #4 I rated so low, it‚Äôs perfect if you need something cheap. And there's no hidden affiliate links or agenda here, just passing on info in case it helps anyone.I also bought a bunch of other chargers/docks that charges Nintendo Switches/StreamDecks/etc in HOPES I can somehow make it work to charge the portal, all 10 of the dock chargers did not work, mostly due to the big back side of the Portal. I can still post some details of what I tried if anyone cares though.My goal here is to find a dock/stand I can fiddle with and make it into a charging stand, I have a few ideas, will post when I figure out the best one."

I have been lucky enough to get a working device but keep the dongle in my work bag in case the slot decides to take a crap. I'm not opening up for another 11 months so I have to live with it. I will state again I am very excited to see so many older gentlemen using the portal to get some much needed game time."

I got mine from GameStop but had to pay the extra $25 to activate Gamestop Pro.

Weller returns to voice Robocop and does a great job. There are many Easter eggs and nods to the films and they also use Basil Poledouris‚Äô score throughout. Aside from being a fun shooter, it has some great police procedural sections where you do everything from investigating murders to handing out parking tickets.As an 80s kid who grew up with these films - it‚Äôs a must have."

I guess I'm more of a casual action rpg'er, used to Beth games and Fallout 3 being my most favorite, but so far, it's held my interest. Just have to get used to the gameplay and the not so much run and gun type of action anymore.I do love turn based games like Xcom, so that does help as well."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18cbvve/a_dad_in_my_neighborhood_didnt_have_the_right/,SadLaser,23 days ago,"It's a massive mostly open world RPG with lots of deep characters, tons of cutscenes and story, lots of major decisions to make, deep character creation/customization, lots of exploration, turn based combat with tons of options.. tons of quests, secrets, etc.  The story is great.  It's very cinematic.  It has 4-player online co-op.  Great game."

You walk into work, manager tells you and at that point it's probably like that across the board in all their stores. Can't justify an oversight like that. I remember when San Andreas came out for PS2, they declined a customer in front of me saying only pre-orders are sold.I did eventually end up getting one but a week late when I pre-ordered a month in advance is unacceptable."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18pd56q/got_one/,CchewiejdsS,6 days ago,"They don‚Äôt have a paper that says ‚Äúpre-ordered‚Äù on it. I think Best Buy does that, but no Gamestop I worked at does that. Maybe yours does? If so, that‚Äôs something the manager there cooked up on their own and isn‚Äôt mandated by the company. Though to be fair, it‚Äôs been years since I‚Äôve worked there, but nothing I‚Äôve preordered recently had a sticker or label on it. So many things could have happened. Maybe the  shipment arrived that morning, and it wasn‚Äôt organized away before that associate found it so they could sell it. At our store, associates were to check the system to see how many of the current stock was preordered before selling them. New hires, often seasonal new hires would forget to check constantly. I myself made that mistake on my first year working there. Sold a Little Mac amiibo that was very rare that somebody had preordered. I didn‚Äôt know it was preordered. I thought we had gone through our preordered stock. I wasn‚Äôt thinking and didn‚Äôt check. Even outside of that, things can so easily be misplaced or categorized the wrong way, or whatever. Especially towards the end of the year, when it‚Äôs so busy the store is chaos, filled with literally the most bottom of the barrel new hires that have zero clue what they‚Äôre doing and are not trained well at all, when the company does not give the store enough hours to do all of the work they‚Äôve been assigned. It‚Äôs so easy for things to go wrong. The whole ‚Äúselling it to your friends‚Äù thing does not happen often. Employees will try and get their friends preorders, or hold on to items that came in that haven‚Äôt been preordered, but it‚Äôs so easy to get caught selling a preordered item to somebody who hasn‚Äôt preordered it that if an item has been preordered then that‚Äôs it. You don‚Äôt sell that to somebody else unless you want a lot of headache. If anything blame the company, its low standards for seasonal employees, its lack of training, or some other thing, but don‚Äôt blame the employees. Especially the managers. They‚Äôre doing their best. Talk to them, be nice. Often you can get them to track down one either at some other store, or they can email product support and get one shipped from gamestop‚Äôs warehouses. But if you‚Äôre not gonna be nice nobody‚Äôs gonna wanna do shit for you. Be nice and they will help."

My favorite feature is that you can listen to audio from two devices simultaneously,and it blends both audio out puts very well.Music doesn‚Äôt sound too bad on them either.Although they do lack  some other features that I wish they had (noise cancellation and pausing when removing from the ear ) I think they are well worth the money."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18ribtg/finally_got_them/,Salty5674,3 days ago,Make sure to restart the console as well which you can do remotely from portal too. I work in Audio/ Visual & IT support and the good ol reboot is the answer for everything
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18ribtg/finally_got_them/,Early-Somewhere-2198,3 days ago,I‚Äôll try it today !  Would be funny if that‚Äôs the issue.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18ribtg/finally_got_them/,Salty5674,3 days ago,Portal can turn on the ps5 from rest mode. I believe it‚Äôs under power save options but I can‚Äôt remember. It went over it in the set up. But yah unfortunately no boot from complete off mode. No harm in leave in rest mode as opposed to off though
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18ribtg/finally_got_them/,Realistic-Plenty-523,3 days ago,I haven‚Äôt had any disconnect issues just yet (fingers crossed).

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18ribtg/finally_got_them/,dangerberry,3 days ago,I use it on Android but the app is on both. There isn't a preprogrammed EQ for the pulse explore yet but you can try some of the ones on the graphic equalizer. I use V shape for them. Eventually when the app updates there will probably be a preset in the library. The Xbox headset and pulse 3d is already in there. Pulse 3d preset sounds way too flat so I'd recommend using the graphic equalizer
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18ribtg/finally_got_them/,Early-Somewhere-2198,3 days ago,Thanks. I‚Äôll give this a try today too. Yeah. I use the Sony app for my iPad and iPhone. My Sony sony wh-1000xm4 sound amazing on them with the tuning. They also sound amazing on the portal plugged in so it‚Äôs weird the explores sound so great out of the box. But sound like trash on the iPhones for music. Just assumed maybe it was a closed system. Excited to hear the news.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18ribtg/finally_got_them/,Salty5674,3 days ago,Yeah it is unfortunately low but I also listen to my AirPods dangerously loud so I think of it as giving my ears a break lol. Try using the individual volume buttons at the top of each earbud. There‚Äôs a + - on both and I think these might be for adjust individual volumes of each earbud somewhat separate from the master volume that you can control from the switch but I‚Äôm not 100% sure and will do more testing later. When I hit the + on each earbud though it did feel like I did get a little boost in volume even though the volume nob didn‚Äôt jump up on portal

They've provided nothing to open up a browser on the portal at all.  The closest I've seen is the software update release notes.

Nothing worked.Only option was to delete everything start from scratch which is fine to some degree but I didn‚Äôt want to just to see it glitches again after putting 2-3 hours again.I like the game‚Äôs stealth mechanics.

I drove about 40 minutes away to a smaller town with a Walmart. Website indicated low stock, so rolled the dice. I figured it was fantom stock, but when I arrived, I found one in the case. I quickly found a nice woman and asked if she could get something out of the case for me. She had no idea what it was. Took it to the cashier for me, who rang it in. As the cashier was handing the receipt and box to me, the original woman came over to scan it again. She said two other people just showed up looking for the same thing, and she wanted to check the SKU to see if they had more - they did not.Now, to the experience with the device. For me, it has worked really well. Last night, my fiancee, her 11 year old, and myself played Fortnite trios together. Boy played on the Series X Xbox, fiancee on the OLED Switch, and myself on the Portal back to the PS5. It was neat that we were able to all play together in the same room, and it greatly improved our teamwork.A couple of things to note, make sure Portal is connected to 5GHz wifi. 2.4GHz was noticeably laggy.

All of you are cumming all over the thing to the point you downvoted someone that literally did nothing but point out that a phone you already have does EXACTLY what this does and more.

Where as you can't really install a VPN on your Playstation Portal so once they detect you are using your mobile(cellphone) hotspot for gaming they will throttle it.By mobile hotspot I mean using your cellphone as a hotspot.

I want to get started on the video games but havent played since battlefront 2 on the psp( I actually had the limited edition Darth Vader one until it got stolen) can you guys recommend which star wars games I should start with? I dont want to jump straight into Jedi survivor!! TIA

Good times, the 2005 Battlefront II was one of my all time favorites on my PSP.As a huge SW fan myself, I have found incredible enjoyment playing the most recent Battlefront II by EA (2017). Despite the controversial launch period, the game had evolved into something beautiful. I would recommend every fan of SW games in general check out, especially if you love Clone Wars content.I would recommend that one and of course Jedi: Fallen Order before you jump into Survivor. Other than that, there haven't been many other Disney made Star Wars games in general. These, though, are top quality.Edit: Also friendly reminder, pretty much all new SW games being made since Disney took over are considered canon, so the stories they tell have been and will continue to be referenced in other SW media."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18gqn22/straight_from_target_truck/,platocplx,18 days ago,Yeah also this. I did notice music was the weakest part on my iPhone or so it seemed there. Gaming audio its some Of the richest sound I‚Äôve heard with buds. Every thing is super clear. Also voice on the phone(like podcasts is super clear as well).
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18gqn22/straight_from_target_truck/,Makoamagana,18 days ago,I‚Äôve used them with the correct tips and do not get this at all. I‚Äôve tried each set of ear tips they provided. I also use apple Beats fit Pro as my daily headphones and they blow these out of the water. I‚Äôve used many different types of in ear headphones and I can say that these are basically near the bottom. Either that or the ones I got are lemons.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18gqn22/straight_from_target_truck/,platocplx,18 days ago,"They arent great for Music via Bluetooth. For gaming and voice related stuff on the phone they are some of the best ive listened to. I think it‚Äôs something with how bluetooth is for these. gaming wise all my games have the bass etc needed. But if you plan to use these for listening to music on the phone, which really is like a secondary function I can get that."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18gqn22/straight_from_target_truck/,FreshGanesh,18 days ago,"This! I‚Äôm a headset whore. I use the Arctis Nova Pro for PC gaming, H9s for PS5, XM5 or Denon Perl 7s for music on phone and got the Explore for Portal. I‚Äôd never consider the Explore for music, but the PS Link has been great and they catch high & mid sound in games I haven‚Äôt found with any other headset.The example I gave in this sub was a standoff in Ghost of Tsushima.  Typically, you watch for the enemy to begin movement before releasing the triangle button. With the Explore and the low latency link, I can actually close my eyes and hear the grunt and leaves-under-feet shuffle as the enemy begins to move to release the button and strike perfectly. I can‚Äôt get that detail of sound with any other high end hearing device I have.For voice chat, Audible & game dialogue, the Explore excel. But again, only with the highs and mids. I‚Äôm knee deep in Baldur‚Äôs on Portal with these and it‚Äôs making the dialogue crisp & clear.I may be an outlier with a headphone addiction, but I also get why no one would want the Explore as their primary headset. To me, they‚Äôre extremely niche in that they‚Äôre only valuable for dialogue & specific sound only via the PS Link on the Portal.Don‚Äôt get these if you want them for versatility and definitely not for music."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18gqn22/straight_from_target_truck/,platocplx,18 days ago,Yeah I think if you have the portal/ps5 and or VR they give a really immersive and clean sound when it comes to gaming audio. Phone features are basic enough to where I like them just for a quick voice call kind of situation.I did give them another shot with music on my phone sounded good but had some beats that work with the iPhone and again can see a difference there.I am curious what codec they use there. I think for most a 150 price point is great for the buds vs 200. But if you can splurge def some of the best gaming audio I‚Äôve heard and super solid connection. Had zero drops with the portal.I think the over ear elite is prob gonna be even better gonna get them in Feb. will use them when I‚Äôm not using VR or the portal.

Keeping the portal at home I can definitely see using the box, but I‚Äôd rather put it on a stand next to my PC in that case.

They also make case for ally, deck, etc, and I‚Äôve heard great things about those. Someone else suggested waterfield, but they don‚Äôt have a case yet.

Read the bad reviews bit decided it solved I problem I unlike many people online did have. Started playing and testing it around the house when it first came. It just changed the whole dynamic of not evening to occupy the entire living room. Will definitely keep using it at home as well.Now I did in fact make it to my holiday and bene having a blast for the past few days. Still play testing with what kind of connection is best suited and it has a specific taste. I admit. But when it works it works well. It just won't always work on every wifi you connect to when your that far from home.No point to my story but that's it. Lovely product"

The worker didn‚Äôt reply but the guy got angry and said he had been waiting for a friend for the last two hours, so I replied and said you can‚Äôt put highly demanded items on hold, he got pissed, whipped out $500 and bought both of them on the spot.

There's really only so much you can do and there are way too many other factors affecting the reason why you just died.Its just funny to me that people are so harsh when adding another millisecond to all those factors completely shatters their decision to even consider playing an FPS video game remotely.

The second it's scanned and everything they'll already know it's yours.As I was talking to someone else on here about it, they have all been damn near sold already by the time they hit the store, they won't even be in shelves. The second it's in their inventory at all, it's posted as ""in stock"" and it can be bought before they even take it out the back.I think the bulk of them will be arriving for in store pick up tomorrow and so on due to Cyber Monday. Because they've only been doing in store pick up, due to them not physically having it yet and can't promise/track them to consumers that far out."

Being able to play my PS5 anywhere may be just what I need. My wife is a very casual gamer (Zelda and animal crossing on the switch mainly) and my 3 daughters (all under 10) are all gamers, so we often end up with myself and the kids sitting in the living room gaming and my wife going off by herself to watch tv and knit in another room. At night after getting the kids to bed, my wife usually goes to bed much earlier than I do because that is my main gaming time with no distractions and no restrictions on what M-rated games I can play. But, the trade-off is that I can‚Äôt remember the last time my wife and I went to bed at the same time. I know she would probably appreciate that a bit more often, so maybe this is the answer. I have been trying the remote play on my phone screen with a spare controller, but the phone screen is just too small and it isn‚Äôt comfortable to stare at for a long time. Our switch, on the other hand, seems like just the right size and this device is even a bit larger, so I am quite intrigued now and highly considering one of these after it releases and people report on how well it performs in various situations."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18a1a1f/playstation_portal_is_extremely_sensitive_to_wifi/,Blaarrrggghhh,27 days ago,"Portal uses the same wifi standard as any other wifi5 device. The issue is that you are streaming a game, so buffering is out of the question. Wifi is and will probably aways be a bad protocol for latency sensitive streaming, since by default it‚Äôs pretty dumb and somehow simple too. One client speaking on a channel means that other clients will wait and listen until the channel is free. Everyone on the channel will have to make the decision if the transmit is something they need to pay attention to, no matter who does the access point belong to.  Many access points sold for home use are set on low 5ghz channels and 80mHz channel width by default, and most people never bother to check the spectrum like you did. If everyone in your apartment building did like you, everyone would have better user experience in all things wifi.Glad you found out the issue and shared it. Lots pf people seem to just blame sony on their crappy home network and 10yr old router."

Different routers have different software as well and there‚Äôs probably million different routers/softwares in portal user base. Most people never bother to upgrade their routers either (they all should). IPad has been out for years, portal for days. Some NIC drivers play well with some router softwares, and some don‚Äôt.Not saying there can‚Äôt  be an issue or two with the portal (streaming) code, but since tons of people have no issues, and others do have, (and if radio frequency issue can certainly be ruled out), I‚Äôd look at client or router software next."

Common answer to all questions in networking is ‚Äùit depends‚Äù. I use enterprise access points, routers and switches at home because I have access to those.A good guideline for quality home network would be something like: not cheap, trustworthy and recognized network gear vendor, needs to have enough bells and whistles , supports all/most modern (wireless) standards and amendments,  and most important: Needs to receive regular software/security upgrades (for home use I think it‚Äôs good if you can receive upgrades automatically).I know quite a few people who use Ubiquiti and Aruba ‚ÄùInstant On‚Äù stuff in their homes/home offices and are quite happy about them.

Everyone has their favorite but Final Fantasy 7 is beloved for good reason. It is my absolute favorite. I would start there and then probably work your way up in numbers from there, excluding the MMORPG numbers 11 and 14 unless that is your thing. If you enjoyed those I would then go to the old school games which are a lot slower but have charm for those who appreciate the series."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/188tbdz/whats_everyone_playing_this_weekend/,Confident_Bunch7612,28 days ago,"Tough call. The original will give you the full story but it is PS1 graphics and turn based. The remakes are taking the original story and splitting it into 3 games, with the second coming out next February. They also have more of an action style married with turn-based. There are some things that are made clearer from the remake by having played original first, but I fully think it is easy enough to follow along and anything ""missed"" is more just original fans pointing out a difference in the remake.So I guess it is which do you think you would prefer more- a full story, PS1 graphics, and traditional turn-based vs. Partial story, PS5 graphics, and action rpg gameplay."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17yjtwt/10_of_10_would_recommend/,Ivebeenchickensouped,1 mo. ago,"I'll never understand why people would choose the PS portal over something like the Logitech G cloud. It does everything the PS Portal does but has double the battery life and supports streaming of all platforms. It also runs Android so it also has all the benefits of an Android device like the much better third-party Remote Play app, emulators, and even basic features like Bluetooth support. The device has been out for a year now too so you can even buy it for cheaper than the PS Portal.The PS Portal is like if Apple made an iPod in 2023 that only played music, didn't have Bluetooth support, and charged $200 for it. While there might be a market for a device like that for Kids whose parents don't want them to have access to an app store you wouldn't see people posting online to justify their purchase. I give it a year or two before the PS Portal gets clearanced out just like the PS Vita TV and that 24"" 3D TV Sony made."

I don‚Äôt need or want what the G Cloud does. Some may, but I don‚Äôt. The G Cloud doesn‚Äôt give me the same experience that the Portal does in terms of the experience streaming PS games."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17yjtwt/10_of_10_would_recommend/,Ivebeenchickensouped,1 mo. ago,I did but your reasons don't make any sense. The PS Portal uses the exact same underlying technology as all devices using the official Sony remote-play app so yes they are the same in terms of performance. The resolution is exactly the same as well and the only benefit the Portal has is the haptics.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17yjtwt/10_of_10_would_recommend/,Juan_Solo84,1 mo. ago,"It‚Äôs also cheaper. And the haptics are a big reason why I like it. The screen is a bit larger. Look, we‚Äôre not gonna convince each other. I don‚Äôt need nor do I want the Logitech. And you don‚Äôt seem to want the Portal. I can understand why you wouldn‚Äôt. Seems like you game in a different way than me. We can all coexist without crapping on folks‚Äô decisions or preferences."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17yjtwt/10_of_10_would_recommend/,Ivebeenchickensouped,1 mo. ago,"Fair enough.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17wp7h0/unplug_your_hdmi_from_your_ps5/,BillySlang,1 mo. ago,I can't confirm but I suspect it does work under certain situations. It was reported that playing the PS5 on a 4k 120fps TV would try to stream the framerate to the portal - causing a ton of stutter. Unplugging the HDMI may send the PS5 into a default 60fps (or something similar) that cleans up his video transmission.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17wp7h0/unplug_your_hdmi_from_your_ps5/,Hey_look_new,1 mo. ago,remote play is always only 1080p60 (at best)
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/17wp7h0/unplug_your_hdmi_from_your_ps5/,BillySlang,1 mo. ago,There is evidentiary video showing that running the ps5 at 120fps adds stutter to the Portal.

If you‚Äôre going direct to modem you are coming up through the internet then back down to your router to portal. Similar to if you went to a friends house. You need to plug the modem in to your router and then wire your ps5 in to the router too.

Having two devices doing routing will set up a double NAT situation, and you're creating two private networks, creating additional latency, and possibly connection issues.Edit: You can also set your router into bridge mode, but you lose the software benefits your router may have."

If you live in an apartment there will be tons of other WiFi signals all interfering with each other so to combat this they are probably all automatically channel switching. This will affect the signal.Other wireless devices that use a 2.4 or 5 signal can interfere. Also apparently kitchen appliances with a lot of metal can cause interference with the signal if they are close to your router.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/1858yo8/thoughts_after_24hrs_this_solves_many_silent/,RoutsYay,1 mo. ago,It's less the upload/download speed and more the overall in home network speed. Some routers are simply not as good as others within the house. One thing I do recommend is to unplug your router for a few minutes and then plug back in. Our home router tends to start having some issues if not occasionally rebooted.

Portal fixes the issue of having access to your phone and remote play at once. Technically if you had no access to your TV screen you could always use the remote play app with the right device. The portal also boosts the overall remote play experience. It has to be the best method.Yes, before you could play on the remote play app and switch to iMessage to answer a text, or answer a call or switch to YouTube to find another video. But it was highly inconvenient and sometimes for my ‚Äúolder‚Äù iPhone 12 low on memory it would just force close remote play.Now my phone is free. This makes the extra $100 worth it. Having my phone free, plus the best controller option, and biggest screen makes it better than spending $100 on a backbone.When its available, I look forward to buying a portal."

Remote play requires no subscription and it‚Äôs your dedicated console. With all your digital library and physical disc ready to go. It‚Äôs not paying $350 for the Gcloud to have a device where you have to pay for a GeForce or gamepass subscription on top of it, and the Xcloud has you wait like an hour to play your game. Etc."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/184lr8f/so_that_just_happened/,rico_muerte,1 mo. ago,"Xcloud is usually a couple of minutes max during peak hours or else it's instantaneous. The hour wait time is those people trying to get on fortnite for free without a sub.GCloud also does remote play of Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at 1080p, plays native android games, and can emulate games up to GameCube. I have the original PS1 Crash games and Ape Escape running at 4x internal resolution and they look fantastic. I usually use it to stream from my Series X. I have paired my Samsung buds to it as well as a portable speaker.It can do a lot but $300+ feels like a bit much. If all you want to do is stream your PlayStation then the portal is a no brainer, especially because of the controller. The experience would definitely be better. If I played on my PS more often I would definitely get one since $200 really isn't too much.Anyway, just wanted to clear some things up especially since none of these new portables ""suck"". We're lucky that there's several on the market now that offer different things for different player types. It's really weird seeing steam deck people coming here telling everyone that they should get that instead. Yeah it's amazing and can do all of these crazy things but if you just want to travel and stream your PlayStation then all of that is useless."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/184lr8f/so_that_just_happened/,TheLoCoRaven,1 mo. ago,True. I don‚Äôt want to pay for another subscription period so that alone makes GeForce and Xcloud a no go for me. I do most of my gaming on PlayStation and only have Premium cause I stacked it during the conversion. My games on my PlayStation along with taking my switch places is all I care about.

I also worked in IT for 5 years; I like to joke that I had Post Tech Support Distress and make light of the facts ‚Äî which I will edit out for you, we both understand there are some very unhappy people out there that just can‚Äôt become thrilled all the time. The ‚ÄúPC Master Race‚Äù elitism is so encouraged by the community, that even if not everyone in the community acts that way I didn‚Äôt want to be a part of it, maybe seep into my own behavior through peer pressure. That said, I‚Äôve been out of IT since 2017, and I‚Äôm starting to avoid tech less.The Portal is easy-peasy, apart from the network optimization I‚Äôm trying to figure out now in advance of Handheld gaming ‚Äúplans.‚Äù By the way, I could use your knowledge: I thought WiFi 6 only increased bandwidth compared to WiFi 5, Wikipedia leads me to think this too, but someone on Reddit said WiFi 6 actually does decrease latency‚Ä¶ is that true? Or just a side benefit of getting a more robust router and putting your first 1-2 devices on the 5G band?I think the Deck is a flexible but fairly modest machine at this point, at least it would open a few doors I don‚Äôt have access to right now (I don‚Äôt own a laptop or even a Windows machine at all). I can‚Äôt afford a Deck right now‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even afford a Portal.

I know the ps5 does. And it was in the rumored specs for the Portal but I believe that got shut down. You should be on 5ghz for sure. Blue tooth can‚Äôt do high bandwidth so the PS link is to support DTS audio. If you are in a big house you should use a mesh wifi solution cause they have a high bandwidth backbone to AP to AP. Much better than using a repeater. I started at tech support but now I‚Äôm a cloud security engineer, so I don‚Äôt get in the weeds of WiFi or consumer hardware. My gaming pc is still on a gtx 980ti with the older sata SSDs. But I was mainly a pc gamer when I was pirating a lot. Now that I got money, the games I don‚Äôt want to buy day 1, I just buy them on console when they‚Äôre $15-30. I like the hassle free life and DualSense haptics.

Instead use a USBC cable from Apple as they‚Äôre very slender and fit easily into the USB C port of the Portal with that case clear case on.via GIPHY

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/189vnny/2hrs_from_home_resort_wifi_the_dream_is_real/,Z3M0G,26 days ago,Portal adds ~80ms of latency under ideal conditions.There is a random stutter every 10ish seconds under ideal conditions.Both can be ignored especially depending on the game.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/189vnny/2hrs_from_home_resort_wifi_the_dream_is_real/,seaniscoolikeice,26 days ago,I think it's dependent on game demand. EAFC was pretty choppy away from home but better in house. Other games not so much.

Sometimes I'll be on my portal, put the ps5 to sleep, power down portal, then later when I turn portal back on, it won't connect to ps5.  Doesn't always do it.  But there have been a handful of times that I had to log in to my ps5 via the console itself and dualsense before being able to connect my portal.My ps5 is password protected.  By which I mean I have to enter a 4 digit pin whenever first booting/waking console.  But when the portal DOES connect and wake up the console, it opens to the PIN prompt and I go from there.

My daughters have a switch and they'll play that, or my wife has some goofy rom/com she wants to watch and I can be right there with them.  Since the portal came out, I've beaten bloodborne and it's dlc (finally got that platinum trophy, dark souls 3 and both dlcs, and am currently playing baldurs gate 3.  BG3 is an incredible game.  Perfect for the portal.  I also love that it's a much slower pace as you really can stop in the middle of anything to do something.  I know the portal isn't a mandatory purchase for a lot of ppl out there, but for my life it honest to God feels like Sony made this thing specifically to meet my needs.

The best and quickest way to determine how your experience will be is to use your phone to remote play. If it runs well then you will probably have no issues with the portal.From my experience though... I had to hard wire my ps5 for the experience to be smooth otherwise it was a buggy mess.

With fees on eBay and stockx the break even (assuming retail price+state sales tax) becomes around 243 and 230 respective on platform. Once the reseller price approaches and crosses break even, once retail stock becomes available resellers will be less incentivized to buy to scalp and then the inventory will sell to end users.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/183qw2y/bluetooth_audio_for_portal/,TheColdTrueNorth,1 mo. ago,You hold the button in your transmitter until it goes into pairing mode (usually comes with blinking light). Then it looks for your wireless earphone and pairs with it. Goes without saying your earphone should already be in pairing mode before you trigger the transmitter button.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/183qw2y/bluetooth_audio_for_portal/,Leelze,1 mo. ago,That's probably because supposedly it only costs Nintendo $10 more per unit when switching to OLED.

With portal now I can play on couch which I am getting more gaming in. Also use my mobile hotspot and play during lunch break in car and at my family house. Also if I am in conference call during work from home and my screen is being used I can now play playstation 5 on the portal. I could not use phone with backbone because I use that to call... Plus with backbone I have to put phone on do not disturb... so no annoying notifications. Its nice to have a dedicated device again. I was skeptical because I had nvidia shield both the tablet and device and used remote play all the time. eventually that hardware became not powerful enough for PS5...This hardware is much better in comparison.

He thought it would sell bad as he did not see a use case, I argumented that it suits my usecase perfectly and this would also be so for many people with children or with only one tv. This continued the few months till launch. Then the news came that it was doing very well in Japan and he slowly started to change his mind. Now he even considers getting one even though he has a Steamdeck thatnhe use for remote play.Thing is that even I had not expected this huge demand. I am glad I pre ordered it as I having a great time playing on it when I can't get to sleep due to my pain disorder.For everyone having one check your router placement, use ethernet cable between PS5 and router, use a quality router and 5G if possible. Also use Qos (quality of service) on your router to give the Portal priority. And most of all enjoy!"

Kinda like getting used to playing at 30fps again. I know supposedly you can turn settings all down, disable HDR and unplug your HDMI cable to get it buttery smooth (allegedly) but that seems like a lot of hassle to me and, as I said, I don't find the experience unplayable at all. Does it look and play exactly like it does on my main TV? No. But I wasn't expecting it too, at least initially anyhow. I figure there's going to be some optimization happening, and I'm fine waiting for the official solution rather than messing with all my settings and plugging/unplugging stuff every time I want to use it."

My grandma, then my grandpa, everyone said he just lost the will to live after she passed. We took a few momentos after they passed, but I mostly avoided the gross squabble over their stuff crap that a lot of my extended family got into after that.Had a really, really rough morning today. Got some terrible, world shattering news, and had a real hard time leaving for work today. As I was walking out, sitting on a pile of lumber that we hang on the wall of our garage, was this beautiful, dark red wooden fat Buddha statue, about 2 inches tall, just smiling at me.I'm an atheist, so I don't really believe in an afterlife or this kind of stuff, but I have no memory of ever taking that Buddha. We moved from an apartment into our house in July, and I don't remember seeing it during the move. Just kind of magically appeared there today, when I needed it most.

And since this was all a community started thing, I currently and will always offer the 3D files COMPLETELY free for all past and new things that come out.Check them out here if you're interested!"

It is the healthiest way to vape, so I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a cleaner method than oil in a pen.

All you'll have is the power cable and network cable hanging down if you don't use WiFi. It'll get a lot of ventilation but you'll still need to clean it from time to time of the dust that builds up.Like op and many commenters here I've lost my tv to my kids and I did have my console connected to my computer monitor but I can't always be at the computer so I used my android and tablets for remote play and PS plus and it's been great.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18g3qig/guys_guys_i_did_the_thing/,Tomtomikeevansallday,15 days ago,A lot of the general complaints are people who wanted to do more things and basically be a PSP 4.0 I think people tend to forget the price when the PSP first released was $249 that was back in 2005..$249 is equivalent to $391 today.. but if you take into consideration that now you're getting a 8-in screen which is almost double the size as before and a 1080p display with with the same capabilities that a dual sense controller has you most likely be looking at a $450 price range which would in fact put it in the range of the steam deck and at that price point do you go with a portal or steam deck.Give it a few more months they'll continue to add stability and performance improvements I mean the thing is already gotten for updates in less than a month..Steamed deck had some similar issues for about the first 3 months now they have verified games and unverified games..  I hope you enjoy the portal

There are probably very little services running on the Portal compared to a phone or computer which have loads maybe it does an occasional update check. Does that make sense?Also if you're having issues and you have the PS5 plugged in via cable make sure you actually change it to wired connection in the settings for some reason unlike any other device you have to manually change this on the PS5.

The problem is that that game can't have lag and mil seconds make a difference from winning or losing. And it's definitely more then a few mil seconds, soüòíI wouldn't dare try it out in the wild, I know it's bad.But any other game that doesn't require that super fast pace quick reaction time should be good I play returnal in the airport and on the airplane no problems. That game is a little fast paced but it's not quite as fast as call of duty.One thing I didn't notice is that the weaker your signal is of course the lower quality of graphics are going to be which is to be expected from any device.I have one bar it was still able to play returnal but the graphics were not good. But when you're in the airport with a few hour delays what does it matter."

It isn‚Äôt OP‚Äôs responsibility to remedy the situation and actually, returning the Portal like ‚Äúhey you sent me an extra one, so I‚Äôm giving it back‚Äù only draws attention to the employee‚Äôs mistake that possibly would‚Äôve gone unnoticed."

When my router restarts the regular connection always comes up first and thus my devices connect to that automatically. I have to make sure it‚Äôs connected the 5G version now before it remote play (granted I don‚Äôt have a Portal and use my phone and a controller but still the connecting is similar). After that it should be very little lag (it will be there no matter what but it should be only a ever so slight delay).
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18qpp3u/input_lag_tips/,Kalowen_,4 days ago,"Hi, why does this work? What does changing it to all this actually do? And does it actually make a difference?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlaystationPortal/comments/18qpp3u/input_lag_tips/,DiabloCielo,4 days ago,"From my understanding, if the PS5 has a poor or weak connection, the portal will struggle and have connection issues, and you will see lag, but if the PS5 has a good connection, then the portal won‚Äôt struggle at all. Unless the upload speeds are less than 5 mbps, the portal will give you bad images and lag. Also, doing this helps with connection, and I'm not sure if you've seen on the PlayStation Reddit people complaining they can‚Äôt connect or downloads are too small or have lots of lag. Doing this to the settings fixes a lot of those issues. During the summer of 23, I was playing lots of Mobile Suite Battle Operations 2, and there were a lot of server problems and connection problems, but everything was fine with the PS servers. Also, nothing came from the games Twitter account that there was a server issue. At the same time, many others were having problems playing online and connecting to online matches, random kicks from online matches, and other stuff, but when changing to these settings, it instantly fixed a lot of those problems. Also this is just a suggestion in case you are having issues with your portal. It helped others with lag and connection issues."

I can tell you that input lag is definitely noticeable. I think a lot of people are use to playing on big tvs with higher input lag and don‚Äôt notice it as much in their portal. But for me any shooters are not as playable. I use it for puzzle games or less hardware taxing games and it‚Äôs a lot better for those

Make sure you hardwire your PS5‚Äôs ethernet connection for an optimal Portal experience.  I played on mine for a few weeks with only wireless enabled on my PS5, and noticed quite a bit of lag and stuttering at times, even with an excellent mesh network and very fast ISP.  Even at much higher than recommended down/upload speeds, the Portal would still bog down at times and even drop connections, but since hardwiring the PS5 to my router, the experience has been exceptional.  I have read reviews of people tweaking various network settings to improve performance, but for me, this single solution has fixed any concerns or doubts about the hardware and its capabilities."

I think the two important elements people need to know is that those two squares represent the one touchpad‚Äôs perimeters of touch commands but both simultaneously receive commands and mirrored.As well, that a single tap makes them available so you don‚Äôt accidentally touch them; and a single tap after that is reading as a touch to the pad without clicking it; whereas, a double tap is a physical click on the touchpad. Multiple fingers can be used on one square or even both squares at the same time.These were weird issues I ran into for myself as well. I just want to share the answers once I figured it out for myself with everyone else. Especially because there is reports of people returning Portals thinking they are defective."

Right now I'm typing this as we watch ink master lol but I could be getting in a few more missions in Spiderman 2.when I have my nieces and nephews over and I need to be in the room with them while they watch the same thing for the 10th time üòÇ.I travel a fair amount so that's self explanatory.All that to say it's gonna be great and I'm hyped!!"

I thought the whole idea was that the portal has better communication than remote play does as long as the PS5 and portal are on the same wifi. But if it doesn‚Äôt need to be the same, then what would be special about the portal aside from the built in controller?If it works well far away that will be fantastic."

I assume is software because I've heard reports of people saying over the past couple months it's gotten more stable even on phones. It also doesn't have to be connected to home wifi even though again I assume the initial set up will need to be on the same wifi as the PS5. Much Iike the intial set up of the new disc drive on the slim. Sony said as long as we have 5mbps of internet we're good anywhere as long as our PS5 has a connection and it's in rest mode. I did hear someone say that at least 15mbps is ideal but not necessary. Most places have at least 40mbps at this point.I hope that helps. First thing I'm going to do is take it to a coffee shop and try it. Lol"

Been like this since GameBoy Advance üòÇThere‚Äôs definitely something more intimate about handheld gaming

I knew i was going to sorta regret the purchase as i hadnt played my ps4 for about 18 months before. I play my switch all the time. I defer to it for games, even waiting a year now for hogwarts legacy.My ps5 is in my bedroom and im.never in there. My fianc√©e doesnt like hanging out lying on the bed while i play(she let me go wild with spidey)So now to he able to play in the office while we hang out, or whenever i have a free moment is a game changer."
