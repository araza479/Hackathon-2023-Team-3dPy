At least the missions are fun but it sucks knowing I could have gotten so much more than what I‚Äôm getting now. Here‚Äôs my thoughts after 3 missions:-VR feel immersive, missing hotas support-resolution is not the best-dialog sounds poop, adjusting levels didn‚Äôt do much-subtitles are close, but targets are far away so, sucks to suck if you can‚Äôt hear the in game dialog i guess?-the briefings are painful for the eyes, a spectacle of colored dots, lines and shapes in your face. It‚Äôs a UX design disaster. I just focus on the subtitles but what‚Äôs GREAT /s is when the scene changes, the screen goes black to change to the next set of information, and it blacks out the subtitles as well. I really hope that gets fixed. Yes I know you can skip the briefings, but I like FEELING like I understand whatever little story there is.-I only experienced a little nausea towards the beginning but that was quickly remedied by focusing my vision on the enemy while flying. Conclusion: The experience, while cool, is watered down by low resolution, complete disconnect from the story due to bad audio mixing of dialog, and the fact that this game is already a watered down VR experience of the PC version. 5/10",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/10/03/fly-the-ps-vr2-powered-skies-of-project-wingman-frontline-59-out-today/

The scale offered by Hello Games supporting full-game VR for NMS has always been beyond reproach, but the visual sharpness (particularly in the mid-distance and beyond) has maybe just held it back from breaking through the top-tier of PSVR2 games. If HG have managed to crack that here‚Ä¶ I really need to try this update when I get home! And as always, the other updates are a mix of improvements, iterations and reimaginings that partly offer the playerbase cool things they were asking for and partly offers even cooler things they‚Äôd never thought about.

369,Moftwell,"August 25, 2023 at 9:53 am PDT","Quick explainer of how time works for MrXile: The state of a game at launch is a result of work done prior to launch. Improvements made to a game after launch is a result of work done after launch. This concept is pretty basic. Yep, we all know how the game was during that first year. But by that point the developers had begun working on the post-launch improvements. NMS launched seven years ago. Thus, it has been seven years of amazing work to reach the point the game‚Äôs at now, and it‚Äôs possible to hold both that opinion and the opinion that the game wasn‚Äôt good on release.

In a time where gamers want more buttons. I guess they figured people would accidentally push the buttons and they more of a hinderance rather than a benefit when you couldn‚Äôt see your hands freely to know. [Shrugs] Fair enough. Man, Sony‚Äôs gotta do something. They were riding a wave when Jack Tretton was running things. Andrew House was the group CEO but the mindset changed. It was sad off the shelf parts were being used, PlayStation wasn‚Äôt innovative anymore and Microsoft‚Äôs hardware was pretty much identical, just felt like you were buying Sony‚Äôs version of a PC only, apparently it wasn‚Äôt cutting edge anymore because, even now, this console generation is about half over and we‚Äôve seen nothing new from: Naughty Dog, Bend, barely from Polyphony, etc as everything is still on PS4. It‚Äôs feeling like the PS2 did having to supplement the loss of every PS3 sold to hoping the PS2 sale would recoup the loss. There‚Äôs nothing really to play on PS5. Horizon, Spider-man, Gran Turismo, God of War, The Show (come on Sony how could you screw that up and allow your IP to be on Xbox and Nintendo. What‚Äôve they done for you?), what‚Äôs the real motivation to bug a PS5? It was said during the PS3 era: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point in investing in Sony if they can‚Äôt even hang on to their exclusives?‚Äù As mentioned, The Show is developed BY SONY and is on Xbox and Nintendo. May as well release on PC as well. PlayStation gave up on Metal Gear Solid. Forever, Metal Gear was synonymous with PlayStation. Then Metal Gear Solid 3 starting popping up on Nintendo 3DS, THEN XBOX. Xbox 360 starting getting Metal Gear games and the only title PlayStation has managed to hang onto is Metal Gear Solid 4, but that‚Äôs already been said to come to Xbox hardware. Don Mattrick stole Final Fantasy XIII and now they‚Äôve gone for the jugular with Activision taking Tony Hawk, CRASH BANDICOOT (HEY PLUMBER BOY, MUSTACHE MAN, YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE HSS ARRIVED.) THE PSX version of Crash games, can be on Game Pass now. Naughty Dogs games go to Game Pass. Spyro goes to Game Pass. You were so worried about Call of Duty, you forgot about the possibility of anything. Potential StarCraft Ghost being the new Halo or Perfect Dark.  AND YOU HAVE BUNGIE! You have the one studio that knows how to combat Halo because they are Halo, but that can all be multiplatform too. PlayStation, youve gotten to complacent and too comfortable and I guess Xbox is going to have to wake you up again. Exclusives you used to have are slipping away. Timed exclusives aren‚Äôt going to cut it. As a PlayStation fan, I learned to be patient as Xbox games came to PlayStation. You think Xbox fans can‚Äôt be or aren‚Äôt the same? They‚Äôll play something else knowing in a years time, they‚Äôll play it on their console of choice. I was patient enough for Phantasy Star Online 2 that STARTED OUT ON PS HARDWARE. You‚Äôve gotten complacent again. Xbox is gonna take MGS4, Xbots can wait for Silent Hill 2 and they will, Starfield will keep them entertained in the meantime. The PlayStation Showcase? You sold what gamers could see on Xbox Series S/X in the coming years. That should‚Äôve been a pre-show. You didn‚Äôt tell the gaming world why THEY NEEDED TO HAVE A PS5. There were no exclusives. Third-party games and TIMED exclusives. That doesn‚Äôt tell me why I have to have PlayStation. Xbox immediately afterward said: ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôre gonna have that too.‚Äù You did the marketing for them so they could show off why I need Xbox. Get it together PlayStation. Under Andrew House with Jack Tretton as his right hand man, PlayStation was a force to be reckoned with. Nobody cares what‚Äôs going on in Europe. Eyes are on the US, that‚Äôs why PlayStation H.Q. had been moved to San Francisco (Californias a crappy state with much better surrounding areas), but Jim Ryan seems like he‚Äôs just waiting to be knighted when he hasn‚Äôt seen a battlefield, hasn‚Äôt risked his life. Just sit in his leather chair and sip his bourbon. Pick your junk up and sew it back on. Get it done.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/19/from-prototypes-to-future-tech-how-ps-vr2-was-built/
465,GutsBerserker,"July 20, 2023 at 1:26 am PDT","I absolutely love VR and I‚Äôm glad Sony is still supporting it with an awesome device that is the PSVR2 and the Dual Senses. Without Sony there would still be 0 (zero!) VR on the console market, let that sink in for a minute. Nintendo cardboard doesn‚Äôt count obviously, come on. Yet I was disappointed with the substantial comfort downgrade the PSVR2 offers compared to the almost perfect PSVR, at least for my face/head shape, it‚Äôs really a shame. The sweet spot is also smaller and more difficult to keep than on PSVR1. On the software side of things I just really hope Sony has some new games up their sleeves, because they need to continue supporting PSVR2 with their own studios, relying on 3rd party and Oculus ports alone will not suffice, especially if you want to show off the power of the PS5 and foveated rendering.You could start with bringing back Astro Bot and the WipEout collection to PSVR2 and then finally release that COLONY WARS PSVRemake.

472,Rene_Reck,"July 21, 2023 at 3:58 am PDT","I think this is the first time I am commenting here. I find it super interesting to see in the report how the psvr2 came about and how much work and know-how you need for such a development.For me also a huge thank you from the bottom of my heart for this great hardware. I love my psvr2 and play with it almost every day. But I have two points of criticism where I hope for improvement in the future. Firstly, there is the very, very short runtime of the Dual Sense Controller. When me and my VR Boys & Girls match online,it may take longer. Unfortunately, after intensive games, you get out of the flow after about two hours because you then have to charge the controllers, I think that works better or you still offer the controllers for sale so that you can switch to a second pair.The second point of criticism is the scanning of the play area. If I scan in the evening, it is no longer recognized during the day and vice versa. This is a little annoying! My wish for the future: Please bring a new Astrobot and wipeout for this amazing machine. There are also so many gamers (myself included) who still haven‚Äôt been able to play Half Life Alyx. Hope to still be able to play this great game on the PSVR2. Thanks again to Sony and the Team for one of the greatest Developments of the last few decades!

What is the point of all this progress, when gamers like myself can‚Äôt play PS VR2 games that use less than native 90 frames per second frame rates without becoming sick and stopping each time? The native frame rates of PS VR2 games should be clearly advertised on the PlayStation Store, and performance modes should be offered in-game to increase native frame rates and alleviate sickness as a result of reprojected frame rate motion blur.

Also having a fan blowing on you can help a lot, as can playing games where you aren‚Äôt using analog sticks to move. Finally, games with high refresh rates without reprojection are less likely to make you feel sick. Games like Demeo, Job/Vacation Sim, Moss 1+2, Pavlov, Pistol Whip, Puzzling Places, Red Matter 2, Rez Infinite, Runner, Song in the Smoke Remastered, both Walking Dead games, The Last Clockwinder, The Light Brigade, and Thumper all run at 90Hz at least, so they‚Äôd be less likely to make you feel ill. There could be more, but it can be tough to find this info for everything.

I really don‚Äôt think the design helps its case: a large screen shoved into the middle of a controller doesn‚Äôt exactly seem ergonomic or portable. The biggest blow for me is the lack of an OLED screen, especially considering the Vita had it nearly 10 years prior. I suppose the price still remains to be seen, but with the licensed Backbone accessory costing $100 alone, I don‚Äôt see this being reasonably-priced enough for it to be a worthwhile proposition to most people; even if it works as seamlessly as a certain other console‚Äôs ‚Äúgamepad‚Äù accessory, it seems far too niche to really catch on.

I haven‚Äôt played Marathon on PC back in the day, so it‚Äôs looks interesting as Bungie‚Äôs first reboot of a beloved PC classic. Ghost Runner 2 and Phantom Blade 2 looks awesome.

Terrible botch timing to release the same trailer, Sony.3. About Foamstars, what is this? A knock-off of Splatoon (which still continues to have a loyal following on the Switch) and then turn it into a live-service game. What kind of ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù are you talking about Crying Jim?

636,KazeEternal,"May 25, 2023 at 12:04 pm PDT","Wifi exclusive Project Q? I got a wishlist for you: 1) Give USB-C hub support for wired Connections. I do this with my phone to get a much more stable connection to my PS5 when remote playing. WiFi in my house is ok and will be getting a Wifi6 overhaul eventually, but my 1gig network is better suited and works great with my PS4 and Phone when remote playing my PS5. 2) Make this sucker have a dock. Not just a charging dock, but a TV dock. I want to be able to dock this device to my TV and allow me to have a full PS5 like experience, using an actual dual sense. No need to go crazy with detachable groups that attach to a controller dock with a touch pad in the middle (though appreciated). If I‚Äôm playing in another room away from my PS5 and the TV suddenly becomes free in that room and I don‚Äôt want to go to the other room, it would be nice to just dock and play. I‚Äôd buy multiples of these docks for each room with a TV if this was a thing.  A lower cost charging dock without all the bells and whistled would be a nice accessory as well. 3) I‚Äôm already asking for Dual Sense support in number 2, so this should be a natural fit. Bluetooth support for multiple devices. Headsets, controllers, keyboards. etc I want it all. Look overall I‚Äôd rather have a PS Vita 2 with backward compatibility with digital PS4 games. If this thing is going to be what I think it is, we‚Äôre looking at a 200 dollar product which is going to make people ask ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just make a Vita 2?‚Äù I doubt it‚Äôll be 100 dollars like the backbone. My little wishlist here will certainly push that price up.

You make Lloyd survive and you have a great sequel with the Death city of Mayville where Fuast becomes a demon of the underworld and you have a sequel.Have the party loose their dragoon spirits (by theft) and reassigned to a boss (because Faust absorbed the dragon‚Äôs spirits and that grants him the ability to trick the dragoon spirit into another master up until it‚Äôs defeated where it recognizes it‚Äôs true master) and do that as they progress into the story.The Legend of Dragoon 2. The first to loose the divine dragoon spirit would be Dart.(Of course) taken by Lloyd who flees off to fight the other dragoons 1 by 1 to steal their dragoon spirits.Why? Well, they basically defeated a God of Destruction so you might as well take out the opposition of your ‚Äúvision‚Äù.If they can‚Äôt fly, they can‚Äôt get to that tower in the sky.Now of course, Lloyd would need some kind of power boost to pull this off since he was defeated by Dart in Disc 3, if he grabs the dragon buster after Rose fate, then that‚Äôs also an advantage for him.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/playstation-showcase-recap-everything-announced-at-todays-show/

This project Q gives you basic streaming functionality.Probably Spotify as well.Allows you to put on MP3 music and video as well.Hopefully PSP/PS Vita ‚ÄúTV‚Äù backwards compatibilityAlso comes with Cloud Streaming with PS5 server blade.

The fact they are using 6 Nano meters processing makes it cooler for the PS5 to run and it‚Äôs fairly easy to get the power of a PS5. The Nintendo Switch found a large portion of the market.Having the same Ryzen architecture, having the same/similar powered would be significantly different than running games on an ARM processor directly and forcing development to build from the ground up an entire game, instead to adjust and optimized the existing games at a lower resolution and not ‚Äúexclusive games‚Äù made specifically for that hybrid handheld, it would be instead a hybrid PS5 home/portable console. It would also have it‚Äôs own dock for additional storage + HDMI to TV and Ethernet, Additional USB ‚Äì C and USB for PS VR2. They can still do all of that with a simple attachment at the back of this device and has USB -C connected to it, you can output video via USB-C.

647,CommandingTiger,"May 27, 2023 at 7:34 am PDT","The Asus ROG Ally that has similar Teraflops as a PS5 is retailing at 700$. I don‚Äôt see how they could be able to make a system as powerful as a PS5 on a mobile device and not charge the same if not more than a PS5. Which is probably why they have this Q Lite as a stand-alone device because you can put in different powered hardware attached to the back of this Q Lite device. So if you‚Äôre only willing to spend 400$, you‚Äôd get a portable device as powerful as a PS4 Pro (that‚Äôs with the Q-Lite), but won‚Äôt play PS5 games.  You want the bigger hardware, then you‚Äôre spending more on this device to get a full PS5 out of it. Then you‚Äôre probably looking at 600$ in total minimum. I totally agree with you that we need a new PSP type device,  Sony however will Not make any other games than their AAA for console nor compromise the experience. However, we‚Äôre not dealing with completely different architecture, it would be all Ryzen and basically run all the same games, except in a portable way. If you just want the Q-Lite, you‚Äôd basically stream games either via Remote Play or Cloud Streaming with PS5 server blades, these are coming down the line so that‚Äôs why they are waiting to show more on the device. Depending if they get the patents, they can make the dual sense controller detachable onto a middle portion holding the touchpad similar to Nintendo Switch. The good thing about the Q-Lite is that you can keep this device and just upgrade the hardware that runs games separately from the 9 inch OLED screen. So if a PS6 version comes up, then it would be cheaper than buying a whole new device. -Replaceable battery is a must.-Hall effect sensor analogs is a must, reduces cost by fixing stick drift.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/playstation-showcase-recap-everything-announced-at-todays-show/

WHY!!??  If I break, or for some reason one of my controllers becomes unusable, that‚Äôs it!  No more PSVR 2, and I will be if I am going to fork out an addition $550 for a brand new headset, just for a pair of working controllers.  I am petitioning you, SONY, right now, (please comment on this others because I have no where else to make this remark) to start selling the controllers separately‚Ä¶ less 3rd party manufacturers begin reverse engineering them and start making their own (which I am sure they are already in the works of doing so), please before the holidays.

Looking forward to full release to try the epic Journey, Infinity Mode, and other multiplayer (vs and co-op) modes available. Here are some notes if the developers are going to be reading. 1) When playing a vs match, the timer should probably be stopped until ball is back in play since someone that is winning can just run down the timer to win overall. 2) There needs to be a way to match with a friend to play vs or co-op. I assume this will be there in the full release, but really important this isn‚Äôt missing. 3) In-game voice-chat as an option when playing with strangers.

883,stage300handsome,"March 12, 2023 at 4:08 pm PDT","I see a lot always say we gamer‚Äôs that have grew up with PlayStation since its start have changed, I don‚Äôt agree with that at all. I think studios are the change, they are full of people who are creative, but like Hollywood have run out of ideals for the most part and as a company they are no longer concerned with your feedback on anything, they assume they have your business, and they pander to other crowds that aren‚Äôt really loyal to the brand or experience. Square Enix a great studio, and I‚Äôm looking forward to a lot of their titles, but I think they lost their magic of always coming up with titles that interest the base now because they try to do to much to please western audiences, when in truth the ones that will buy a title preorder or day one are not looking for western styles.And that brings me to the point now with this State of Play that I finally got around to watching because most of them the past yr haven‚Äôt been good or having something your wanting to see, even though Baldur‚Äôs and a few of the other single player rpgs and action adventures looked good , so much pushing the sucide squad and online ones along with the woke stuff, really kind of brought it done. But that is the best thing out what Sony is that during the Ps1 and 2 its was full of any genre you wanted. There‚Äôs still just as much variety as then but they all lean toward the same thing wanting online and free for all.I have two sons who like to game and for the past few yrs its been Fortnite and CoD nonstop back and forth all day that they can, and I have every system from the late 80‚Äôs up to now. And they have sat and played around with them in the past or sat and watched me, it was usually that looks boring or it cheats so bad, looks rough. But now that they have gotten older, I will see them try some different games here and there, and was really shocked to learn they got Legend of Dragoon and Wild Arms and been playing them the past few weeks. But apparently, they didn‚Äôt realize I had the originals. I found out by taking them out to Game Stop and a few local used gaming stores, they were looking where I was looking and I said guys used passed by the C‚Äôs already, then I heard my youngest ask a worker if they  had chrono trigger for Ps4 or 5 and I was like I got that at home if you want to play it, but its not on the newest consoles. They then came up asking questions about others, so they must have been researching or seen others watching their youtube videos on the games they play, I still don‚Äôt get that, but was kind of glad  they were trying some of my favorites now. And for the last month I haven‚Äôt heard shooting or all the Fortnite crazy sounds coming from their room. But Hey, maybe we will find out what Bluepoint has going on soon, or Insomniac‚Äôs known games like Spiderman or Wolverine since those guys at least get how to make superhero games, or maybe Ronin or one of the FF games coming up. I figure State of Decay will continue on like the monthly games on Plus, a once in a while shock you month.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/02/23/state-of-play-february-2023-all-trailers-and-complete-recap/

Horizon, Star Wars, etc. upon start of the game seem to think that the face buttons of the Right Sense controller are on the left.  And the Options button doesn‚Äôt work at all in games. In the PS5 Home System menus, the Sense controllers work fine.  This is ONLY an issue within games themselves. Removing the Sense controllers from Accessories and re-adding them doesn‚Äôt work. The only solution I‚Äôve found is to start a game, then within that game, take off my headset, and use a tiny pin to poke the reset hole in each controller for 5 seconds each to reset the Sense controllers.  Then, after they‚Äôve both been reset and disconnected, hit the PlayStation button on my Right Sense controller, and then the Left Sense Controller to reconnect (while still in the game I want to play), and then they work properly. Please note that if I close the game and restart it ‚Äì OR, if I select a different game entirely ‚Äì this process will need to be repeated. The other solution is to completely turn off the PS5.  Start it up, and use ONLY my DualSense controller.  Start the game with the DualSense controller.  And THEN turn on the Right and then Left Sense controllers within the game.  That works too.

Yaw, and Roll of headset were fine (moving  the head set up or down, tilting my head).

The company halved its forecast for shipments of the PSVR2, which is set for a Feb. 22 release, this quarter to about a million units, said people familiar with its deliberations. Sony had previously aimed to have 2 million headsets ready for the launch quarter and leverage its second-generation headset to drive user growth and adoption for VR. The Tokyo-based electronics giant has told a supply partner to expect reduced display panel orders, according to the people, who asked not to be named as the information is not public. The company now plans to ship around 1.5 million units between this April and March next year, they added, though that figure may be adjusted further in response to demand.

If you have congrats. You probably know about Battlefront and Battlefront 2 and Jedi Fallen Order. They are remaking Jedi Fallen Order to Jedi Survivor. New abilities new lightsaber customizations in fact if you preorder it will give a Han Solo blaster customization option and Luke Skywalker lightsaber customization option and Cal Kestis look like a redhead Obi-Wan Kenobi but you also pay extra which makes sense but that‚Äôs besides the point. The point is they remake games and consoles and PC‚Äôs for better graphics and gameplay. If they don‚Äôt do that PS WILL BE CANCELED and that means with NO PS, NO GAMES FOR PC! So be happy that you can purchase these games because for some of us GAMING IS LIFE and without that we wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with ourselves (we would go insane). SO JUST BE HAPPY FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME!!! DEEZNUHTS444üëÄ",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/15/playstation-in-2023-highlights/
