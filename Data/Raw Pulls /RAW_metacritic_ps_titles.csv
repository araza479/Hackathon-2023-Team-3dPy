We choose to play as either Matthew Kolth, an occult obsessed paranormal investigator, into nightmarish scenes to fight perturbing monsters from ghastly realms, or as Della Hartfort, as she slithers her way stealthy to avoid the same monsters Matthew is emptying his bullets upon.
Join either Mr. Kolth or Mrs.Hartfort as they both try to make sense of a hellish adventure that leads them into the depths of their own psyche and back again.
Live through their difference of reality-gaze which merges fiction and ethereal dream sequences and go on to fight against evil in this dimension…and the next.
Matthew Kolth is a paranormal investigator at the turn of the century that takes on a new case at Hartford Mansion. There he meets Della, the wife of a rich businessman that believes her house to be haunted. She sees visions of demons and beasts of other dimensions.
As a player, we have two deliberate choices: We either pick Matthew or Della, and both alternatives offer completely different play styles and adventures.
Matthew must journey through the dream-like yet horror filled halls of the Hartford mansion before heading to Carcosa Asylum in pursuit of Della and the answers she holds. You must guide him from the bone chilling depths of his own psyche and back into stability all the while fighting terrifying monsters and trying to solve mind bending puzzles to progress through the game.
Matthew must fight with enemies from outer space, other dimensions, and from the depths of his own soul to avail victorious from this mysterious and blood curdling case. Matthew must overcome his inner demons in a story that twists and turns as you must follow your instincts to find evidence – whether this evidence tells more about the case or about Matthew himself, is to be found out.
Alternatively, you can play as Della and befriend with shadows. She will embark on the same path Matthew has ventured, however she would only have her stealth-wise skills to confront or avoid those monsters. Inevitably, her version of this dangerous undertaking will also trigger her soul to face her own inner demons as well, but perhaps she has a different spectrum of opinions on the same worldly matters of which Matthew has a “male-gaze” upon, her own interpretation, as an audacious Victorian-lady...",https://www.metacritic.com/game/venatrix/

1367,Wobbledogs: Console Edition,"May 23, 2023","Wobbledogs is a 3D pet simulation where you raise your own personal hive of rapidly mutating dogs, physically simulated all the way down to their guts! It’s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique, and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary lines advance.

Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora, just like in the gif above. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection!

Dogs need a place to call home, and it’s up to you to create an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate them however you’d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you can prioritize whatever you like the most!

The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects.

Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe, but it’s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that’s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled itself into a particularly tight space. These dogs try their best, but sometimes they need a bit of extra help!",https://www.metacritic.com/game/wobbledogs-console-edition/

1988,"""Buy The Game, I Have a Gun"" -Sheesh-Man","Jan 29, 2023","This game is worth every penny, and you should buy it right now, why? Firstly because the whole story was written during a live-stream, which makes the story totally nonsensical! If this doesn't convince you remember that not only do I have a gun, I also know all your secrets. This is of course a joke, I do not know your secrets, yet. The game even features some of the most famous actors to have ever lived, including ""Thrash94Gaming"" you might know him for never being in a movie. ""LaraCroft86"" you might know her for also not being in any movie. Lastly but mostly least ""Gamer Jeffro"" for his famous role as Asa Gray in the video game that you are about to buy. Thankfully this game also includes two actors from Kimulator's Films, sadly they also were never in anything noteworthy.

You might wonder who I am, well I'm Sheesh-Man, I literally come from another planet, I'm like an alien, a spooky sheeshing alien to say the truth. Don't challenge me or I will sheesh your whole family, including your dog, it's not a threat, it's a fact.

Now back to the game, it features over 2 hours of video footage of me and my worst enemy Swag-Girl, who even says Swag in 2023? Pft, we all know Sheeshing is the new hip and cool thing to do.

This game is an interactive movie telling the story of how I went on earth and became a super-hero or whatever, it's pretty sick if you ask me! Not sick in the sense that you will throw up, but in the sense that it's cool. This my friend was a word play, you can expect this level of humour in the game, may I say it even gets better than this, not a lot, but at least a little bit.

The game as a ton of bonus content too! Even a video of Mini the dog taking a shower, can you believe it? I surely can, because it's true and it's literally in the game.

Either way, I don't think you need more reasons to buy the game but I will give you another one, this game includes 4 PSN Avatars! Use them to show all your friends that you are indeed the best gamer of the gamers.",https://www.metacritic.com/game/buy-the-game-i-have-a-gun-sheesh-man/
