0,richman 10,PC,Gamersky,Critic,"Rich man series have existed for more than 30 years, it is obvious that Rich Man 10 wants to ""be modern"", which means that adds online gameplay and gets sped up, instead of ""stay retro"". As a result, the game just goes half-and-half and let every fan be disappointed.","Oct 28, 2019",63

2,mahjong 2016,Xbox Series X,TheXboxHub,Critic,"With seventy puzzle layouts and no frills, Mahjong - Xbox Series X|S might seem like the ideal purchase for someone who wants a no-nonsense version of the classic game. But when the simplest interactions come with baggage, there’s no reason to pick this over the many other options on the Xbox Store.","Jan 8, 2023",40

4,beholder 3,PC,Movies Games and Tech,Critic,"Beholder 3 takes the best bits of the first two games in this series and blends them together to make a fun, dark, morally challenging point-and-click adventure. While slow in pace is still thoroughly enjoyable. If you like dystopian fiction, if you like puzzle-based point-and-click adventures, if you like strong narrative then Beholder 3 might just be the game for you. It’s one I will be playing again and again.","Mar 26, 2022",67
5,beholder 3,PC,GameGrin,Critic,"A pretty cool dystopian experience filled with blackmail, intimidation, and gross human rights violations. The dark themes make it a bit of a heavy hitter.","May 8, 2022",70

The game feels very high-stakes and intense. The choice and consequences are mechanic is well thought out.

Bad-
Bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. Dialogue is so bland and has no soul. Gameplay design is so tedious and just not fun

Thoughts-
Beholder 3 takes all that worked in Alawar’s previous Beholder games, and coalesces them into a neat little package that doesn’t shy from going into dark spaces with its political drama and depiction of a totalitarian state. Its choice and consequence mechanics work really well in tandem with its constantly high-stakes gameplay. However, many of these ideas get dragged down by bland design and dialogue, and loads of technical inefficiencies. Beholder 3 might not appeal to everyone, but the bottom line is this – if you liked Beholder and Beholder 2, you will probably end up liking this one as well.","Mar 4, 2022",6
8,cassiodora,PlayStation 5,PSX Brasil,Critic,Cassiodora manages to be both traditional and innovative; light and challenging; intense and relaxing. This results in a shmup that takes advantage of the medieval theme in a well-balanced and surprising way that can please fans of the genre and even attract new fans to it.,"Dec 15, 2022",80

10,grime,PC,NME,Critic,"GRIME is such a consistently astounding game that it’s hard to believe it didn’t just fall out of the sky fully formed. The world it’s set in is one of the most compelling in recent memory, the combat is weighty, satisfying, and incredibly difficult, and the ecstatic feeling you get upon conquering some of the bigger challenges rivals the same feeling you get in a Dark Souls game.","Aug 1, 2021",81
11,grime,PC,COGconnected,Critic,"Ultimately, Grime is an overall successful transposition of the 2D Soulslike subgenre into a new and engaging world. Although it lacks the emotional richness of the best Souls games, Grime’s striking environments, solid combat, imaginative enemies and original mechanics all work together in harmony, and it clearly establishes a formula that is open to refinement and possibility.","Aug 2, 2021",82
12,grime,PC,Hatrax113,User,"Simply the perfect fusion between a metroidvania and a souls-like, a challenging RPG with real rewards for exploration and build decisions. In addition to this, the lore and story is great, and made me get affectioned to characters like Yon and Shidra. Highly suggested to anyone who is ready for a challenging immersive adventure.","Aug 29, 2023",7.9
13,grime,PC,Drools79,User,"Ok, this game has completely blown me away so far I’m about 8 hours into it.  If you are looking for casual gameplay this is not it, this game is brutal in a way similar to how the souls games are.  If you’ve ever played Blasphemous, think of it similar to that but in my opinion this is way more polished.","Aug 4, 2021",10
