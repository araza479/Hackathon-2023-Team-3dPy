Without spoiling the surprise, even meta aspects of how you play lead you down certain paths. You can’t save at a seemingly important choice and go back and see the other path, but you have to play again, and you will notice a whole different outcome. This way of path choosing was an innovation that I had never expected, and what left me thinking about the smaller things I do in real life too. This system is something special, and despite smaller issues with the characters, this system has shown a new era for visual novels.","Nov 1, 2023",56

53,slender the arrival,PC,babylonianark60,User,"Slender: The Arrival is a true masterpiece of the horror genre, offering an experience that's not just spine-tingling but also emotionally gripping. It's one of those rare games that transcends typical jump scares and shallow storytelling to deliver an unforgettable, nerve-wracking journey that will haunt your dreams for nights to come.

The game's atmosphere is its most outstanding feature. From the moment you step into the eerie woods, the oppressive silence and the distant echoes of footsteps keep you on the edge of your seat. The environmental design is absolutely brilliant, with every detail contributing to the overwhelming sense of dread. The use of darkness and shadows is impeccable, making every step you take feel like a heart-pounding gamble.

The narrative, while relatively simple, is told in a way that pulls you deeper into the mystery. As you uncover the story through various notes, audio recordings, and unsettling encounters, you'll find yourself both desperate to escape and oddly compelled to understand the horrors that lie in the shadows.

One of the game's defining features is its monster, the Slender Man himself. This faceless, enigmatic entity is relentless in his pursuit, and the developers have nailed the art of building tension through his appearances. It's impossible to describe the sheer terror of turning around and finding him standing there, his featureless face staring into your soul. The fear he instills is genuine and spine-chilling.

Gameplay mechanics are simple yet effective, making every task, like collecting pages or restoring power, a daunting challenge in the face of Slender Man's relentless pursuit. The controls are responsive, and the first-person perspective immerses you completely in the experience. The occasional switch to different characters adds variety and keeps you invested in the unfolding narrative.

The graphics and sound design are top-notch. The game's visuals are hauntingly beautiful, and the audio, from the distant footsteps to the sudden bursts of white noise, is expertly crafted to send shivers down your spine.

Slender: The Arrival is not just a game; it's an emotional rollercoaster that taps into primal fears. It's a horror experience that transcends the medium, leaving a lasting impression that will stay with you long after the credits roll. In the world of horror gaming, Slender: The Arrival is an absolute must-play, setting a standard that few games can hope to match. It's a testament to the power of interactive storytelling and the ability to terrify us in ways no other form of media can. If you're a horror fan, or even if you're not, do yourself a favor and experience the fear, tension, and brilliance of Slender: The Arrival.","Oct 26, 2023",6.1

It’s a scrappy, low-budget underdog that’s full of heart and empathy, and it has a message to share. Though the game is a sequel, those interested can certainly start with this version, as its predecessor is vaguely recapped.

Like the original, the foundations of something cool is here. I know when I reviewed the first game, I hoped that there would be a sequel with improvements in various areas, and although there are some, Overpass 2 still has annoyances that continue to hold the franchise back. The experiment of the first game continued with the release of a second, but the result is one that feels like it could have used more time.

Yet anchored in a very classic formula which could have been detrimental to it, Lords of the Fallen does not rest on the laurels of others and delivers some interesting ideas which set it apart from the competition. Despite everything, the title still has too many small flaws and frustrations to climb to the top of the rankings. That being said, we are convinced of the potential of the license, even if it will need more effort to assert itself and flourish.

They’re genuinely entertaining as “no-frills” examples of the tactics JRPG genre. However, the Switch has so many of them now. Recent years have brought us the incredible remake of Tactics Ogre, the stunning Triangle Strategy, and earlier this year we got, arguably, the finest Fire Emblem to date. I don’t expect Rideon to get to that standard, and I think there’s plenty of room for a “no frills” and inexpensive little experience in between the big guns, but I would still like to see the series continue to evolve, rather than simply find ways to continue to repackage the existing assets.","May 8, 2023",60

There's plenty of replayability though if you want to unlock all the endings, but many of them involve only slight variations of events you’ll have seen before.

Some might balk over the absence of enemies or outright peril but hungry aliens, killer robots, or demon possessed soldiers would only serve as annoying distractions and just get in the way. All in all, Red Matter is an awesome science fiction yarn built with an eye for dreamy, retro futurism aesthetic.","Dec 17, 2018",84

As a big fan of games like Total Air War, F22 Lighting, Jane's IAF and other flight simulators, Project Wingman is just such a welcome addition to the arcade air combat genre. It greatly improves on Ace Combat, and is much better in writing, graphics and gameplay. It doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't suffer from the prepubescent and ear-bleeding writing and banter of Ace Combat 7. Fans of the series will greatly appreciate this and fans of simulators like me, will also love this. Our genre is really starved of good games. As a project made by only a two-man team, this game is just marvelous. I especially like how the aircraft are much more detailed and have better styling than in Ace Combat. You can tell that this game was built with passion with so many fine details, down to the camo of the planes to the messy skies with smoke trails and debris everywhere to the way planes fall to the ground while burning. It is also significantly harder than Ace Combat and the missions are more complex, longer and loaded with numerous targets.

322,synergia,PC,PublicNuisance,User,"Synergia has some of the best overall presentation and atmosphere of any visual novel I have played. Everything from the opening video; to the menus; to the music; to the art are all top notch. It all ties together to just ooze cyberpunk out of every crevice. The story itself isn’t bad but it gets really rushed near the end and the ending just feels abrupt. The romantic relationship between Mara and Cila also feels a little forced and rushed. They go from cold and awkward to saying how they love each other within a matter of days with nothing in between. There is also a ton of story dumped on the reader in the last half hour or so which makes keeping track of new developments and characters an issue only for the game to abruptly end anyway. The endings were another issue of mine. The store page lists “multiple endings” but in truth there are only two. Now two is more than one so they’re not lying exactly but when I see “multiple endings” I expect several different ones. Even worse is that to access the epilogue you need to have completed both endings. My real issue with that is that there is a single epilogue, which means that regardless of which ending you get the epilogue doesn’t change at all. Overall the game just lacks choices and branching. It’s not a kinetic novel but it also isn’t really choice driven. It’s stuck in an uncomfortable no man’s land. I really wished that the game had developed the character “Rat” more as well as had more of Darla.

I played Synergia on Linux. It never crashed and I didn’t notice any spelling errors. You can save whenever you want and there are one hundred forty four save slots. Alt-Tab didn’t work.

Synergia isn’t a bad game, in fact it was very close to being a great game, but the story sinks it near the end to where it is hard to  recommend it. There are worse visual novels out there but also better ones. It’s a shame because aside from the story the game has so much going for it. I finished my first play through in three hours and nine minutes and I paid $13.49 CAD for it. That isn’t terrible value but also not fantastic. I think sub $10 is a better price range for it.

This game would certainly benefit from having more missions, but what's already present has a lot of replay value and room for mastery. The music composed by Brandon Mckagan is absolutely fitting **** like Trepang, it has over the top pacing, with great drums and guitar present in almost every track.

The game needs some more ironing to its wings to get rid of the bugs and seriously tone down the ridiculous time limits to really take off. Then again, there is no air combat game quite like it around at the moment. For all its bents and bullet holes in the game design, there’s an indelible picturesqueness in the game's visceral action.

The game follows the story of 2 guys Jack and Amelia, during the WWII
Let me say the story is fiction , so do not exepect anything super real ,but that's the point, everything is told as an Interview to the old 90yo pilots, kinda of fun indeed.
Interview 3d models aren't so great althougt the storytelling isn't that bad, despite voiceover doesn't shine, but this is not the reason why you buy this game isn't it ?
Where the game letterally shines is in the game itself , it starts quite slow , the first missions are short and ment to be tutorials ,althoug I flew over NY tutorial for hours for my personal enjoyment ! simply amazing !.
But when the battle begins, oh boy ,you'll never stop until you did it ! Sometimes could be hard , but it's because you need to find the correct approach to knock down the objectives.
But I don't want to spoil anything , you have to figure it out by yourself. Maybe some missions are a bit longer than they should be or a bit hard but it isn't a big deal afterall
it' about 20$ so I really don't find any reason at all ,if you like action flight games as Blazing Angels or Crimson Skies to not buy this game","Oct 9, 2017",6.3

I played it relatively cautiously, conserving ammo when I could, and I didn’t feel like the madness system worked against me. But the game is at its best in the big arena fights, with big groups of enemies, a shredding soundtrack, and no option but to take the fight to them. The limited narrative works well for it, mostly because players can focus on the combat and on how they can improve their performance.

The tale may be somewhat self-contained, but the ties to the rest of the city make it feel like a proper expansion versus something completely siloed off from the rest of the game.

453,cyberpunk 2077 phantom liberty,PC,FVpeanut,User,"Phantom Liberty brings a visceral narrative to the already soul-gripping adventure of Cyberpunk. V finds themselves on another pilgrimage fueled with espionage and intrigue, and must plunge deep into a web of broken loyalties, and political power plays to save the President of the NUSA with the help of FIA Agent Solom Reed. (played by Idris Elba)  	

In the pulsating heart of the megalopolis that is Night City, we find ourselves in a self-governed combat zone that is Dogtown. Contacted by FIA Agent Intelligence analyst, Song So Mi ""Songbird"", with the promise of helping V to eliminate the biochip lodged in their head, V must help to save the President of the NUSA Rosalind Myers, as Space Force One crashes in Dogtown.  	

While adding a compelling new narrative to Cyberpunk, Phantom Liberty adds a plethora of new weapons, a new skill tree, gigs, and side quests, to the abundance of activities that make up Night City. From completing side gigs for ‘Mr. Hands’ to completing quests that add to the story within Phantom Liberty, you’ll find yourself fully submerged for hours within Dogtown. 	

Phantom Liberty adds a stellar lineup of characters to help fill out the narrative. Colonel  Hansen, a veteran of the ‘Unification War’ rules with an iron fist with the help of his militia, ‘Barghest Soldiers. Alex is an aspiring braindance actress turned FIA agent whose shapeshifting abilities make her a powerful tool within the FIA. Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba) has a dossier filled with assassination attempts, successful negotiation attempts with kidnappers, and multiple sabotage operations and coups in South American republics. His last mission was to help build a successful spy network within Night City during the ‘Unification War’. In 2070 after realizing the war was a lost cause the NUSA disbanded his cell and he dropped off the radar. So Mi ""Songbird"" is President Myers’ right hand and an incredibly powerful netrunner. Rosalind Myers is the former CEO of Militech and is currently in her third term as President of the New United States of America. 	

I was enamored with the abundance of detail within Dogtown. From the swarming shop-packed ‘EBM Petrochem Stadium’ that breathes like a modern-day shopping mall to the larger-than-life neon-light pyramid that is ‘Heavy Hearts Club’, CD PROJEKT RED perfectly immerses you in the Cyberpunk universe. 

My initial journey with Cyberpunk was a sour one. After experiencing multiple game-breaking bugs at launch, I had given up. Periodically checking in with each update but never feeling that investment like I did with ‘The Witcher 3’. Then came update 2.0 and I was hooked. Then comes Phantom Liberty forever cementing Cyberpunk: 2077 into my top five games within the new decade, if not the top three. 

Phantom Liberty is CD PROJEKT RED at perfection. An encapsulating story, breathtaking visuals, deep and compelling characters, and a spy thriller that culminates in an almost alien-like game of cat and mouse. Phantom Liberty is a must-buy.","Dec 8, 2023",10

The card flow might be too random for some players but I find the uncertainty it creates a good way to keep tension and difficulty up.

This half-baked and wildly inconsistent retelling of the excellent TV series shows the promise of what an Avatar game could maybe be, but a baffling choice of which scenes to highlight, a clunky camera and combat, hilarious balance problems, and an overreliance on middling block puzzles and boring fetch quests leaves our search for the real Avatar still desperately out of luck. With more Avatar shows and movies on the way, it’s just downright odd how Quest for Balance has managed to arrive at this point in time as both an unsatisfying entry point for newcomers and a poor way to revisit it for dedicated fans.","Sep 27, 2023",40

It’s hard to believe that this campaign was only $10 when Resident Evil 3 Remake, a game of similar length yet far less satisfying, was full price just three years ago. It’s even more surprising that just last year we were playing Shadows of Rose, a lightweight, uninspiring retread of Resident Evil Village that similarly tried to make old locales feel new again, but failed to match the quality of the base game. Separate Ways is more like a Resident Evil 2-style parallel campaign than a bonus DLC, and it’s been given the level of polish and care it deserves. Separate Ways has always been essential to the RE4 experience, but the remake elevates it to the quality of a standalone Resident Evil game. And at just $10, it might be the best value in gaming this year.","Sep 25, 2023",88

As one who holds Bloodborne in the highest regard as one of FromSoftware’s finest achievements, I found myself absolutely enamored with Round 8 Studio’s unique, clever take on the formula. While the game broadly functions similarly to the best the Soulslike genre has to offer, Lies of P‘s tweaks and refinements are so masterfully planned out and implemented that they make every moment of gameplay a pleasure. From the dopamine hits provided by exploring the labyrinthine level layouts, to the extreme elation of finally besting a challenging boss, there’s nary a moment of Lies of P‘s meaty campaign that feels wasted or unsatisfactory. With a post-credits teaser hinting at a second incredible twist on another literary classic lying in wait, the future looks bright for this new addition to the genre.

One thing I absolutely hated were the parts where “your actions have consequences”, but I had no idea what my options were, because they aren’t presented to you clearly at all, but also affect which ending you get. I felt that was pretty unfair. I had to watch a video to figure out what to do at two parts in the game, which ****. 

The controls are beyond janky, what with the strange thumbstick  twisting mechanic. Not unplayable, just annoying and not very fun to use controls like that.

Also, the game was not scary… like, at all. There are some creepy looking monsters, but that’s it. They aren’t scary, just creepy. I didn’t really ever feel anxious enough to panic or fumble anything.

612,the crew motorfest,PlayStation 5,Gaming Age,Critic,"Overall, I’d say The Crew Motorfest is a big step up from the prior games in the series, and gives some hope for additional variety in open world racers in the future. Granted, it sticks pretty close to the same formula that Forza Horizon has, but there’s enough differences between the two to make this still feel like a worthwhile use of your time. It’s a gorgeous game in motion as well, which doesn’t hurt. As far as complaints go, mine are pretty minor, in that I don’t care for the limited fast travel system that’s only tied to the intro areas for each Playlist, and I wish the server didn’t time out as quickly as it does when you go idle. Outside of that, I’ve really dug Ubisoft’s latest attempt at an open-world racer, and I think you will too.","Sep 25, 2023",76
613,the crew motorfest,PlayStation 5,Jeuxvideo.com,Critic,"Beautiful, rich in content, varied in what it offers, The Crew Motorfest is a very good 100% arcade open world racing game. Riding on the heels of Forza Horizon, it is currently one of the most successful clones of the genre leader, even if this means that the French studio preferred to take the lead from its British competitor rather than plow its own furrow. The Ivory Tower software is more effective than surprising, but its qualities are numerous enough that we do not look at its predecessors, in retro, with regrets.","Sep 19, 2023",80

Does it push beyond Super Bomberman R? In some ways, yes, but there could well have been more to take this sequel to the next level.

Yet, it also feels like the developers had been holding out, not bringing out the most compelling elements of the series until it’s almost over. It gives them momentum for the ending, but why did they wait so long, knowing there’s limited space for this story?

Do yourself a favor and look up the Items and Shrines wikis, they will help out a lot, not only in understanding the game but also understanding *why* it's so good.

Every time you play the game, you are not only faced with a new randomized level/maze that can be completed in one sitting, but each time you play you're practically guaranteed to find a powerup you've never seen before.
The more you play, the more powerups you unlock for future runs.
The game as a whole is not so challenging that you're going to give up.
The entire game was made by ONE GUY!  Support this man, as he deserves all the prase!
He's often looking through and responding to forums, so he seems to listen to feedback quite well.
Did I mention infinite replayability?  How many PvE games can make that claim?  Zero that's how many.
Cons:  Sometimes randomness kills your run?  I don't like the randomness of the upgrade stations.  I wish their was an option to donate 99 scrap to see a list of potential upgrades or something.  The dumb overlord robots give you ""lil' whoever"" too much.  Also shield drones are lame.  Feels bad to get lame upgrades.  When you get something good that compliments your other upgrades it feels great though, just wish it was more common.

TL;DR
Game is very good, and was created by a single person.  Scratches that Super Metroid Itch for eternity with a new experience each time you play.  Roguelikes are not for everyone though, and some runs you'll waste hours before you see that luck has reduced your chances greatly.

Edit:  I had some cons in the past but those have been updated and removed.  This game is now nearly perfect.  The only thing I would add is more secret endings!  :D","Jun 30, 2021",10
729,a robot named fight,Nintendo Switch,GameSpace,Critic,"If you have been itching for a Metroidvania game with a good sense of humor and a new level of challenge, A Robot Named Fight is worth the investment of time and $12.99 USD. Your metal will be tested as you throw a lot of robots at a ton of meat, but the Megabeast must be vanquished and its secrets must be revealed - in at least one of its multiple endings.","Apr 25, 2018",71
730,a robot named fight,Nintendo Switch,Nintendo Life,Critic,"The comparisons to Nintendo’s much-loved Metroid franchise might seem excessive, but A Robot Named Fight makes little effort to differentiate itself from the source material it has been inspired by. What it does manage to do is provide endless replay value with its procedural generated platform action, unique items and large variety of enemies. The co-op mode is also a welcomed inclusion. The trade-off here, as mentioned, is no real story or character development beyond the basics to motivate you to save the day and the repetitive nature associated with permadeath. If you can look past this, what’s on offer is a satisfying alternative to the space adventures of Samus.","May 9, 2018",70

I have 80+ hours in this and *still* haven't beaten the final ending or unlocked everything.
Do yourself a favor and look up the Items and Shrines wikis, they will help out a lot, not only in understanding the game but also understanding *why* it's so good.
Every time you play, the world gets more and more varied so the very first run is essentially the simplest and toughest but you end up unlocking so much plus you can save any previous seed with a code so you never lose your favorite map layouts and configurations.
Brilliant game!","Feb 22, 2023",7.6

Daymare 1994 has the same great atmosphere, an awesome spooky sound and I like the story and somehow unique setting. I would rate this game with an 8/10 or even 9/10 - if combat would be less frustrating. The enemies are faster than light and even on the easiest difficulty it‘s hard to avoid damage. Enemies tend to appear in groups, and while you try to freeze or shoot one of them, another one attacks you from the side or behind. I hope they release an update that allows slower combat. They put a lot of effort into cutscenes and everything else, only the combat system makes it difficult to enjoy this survival horror experience.","Aug 31, 2023",7

My friends and I have tried for 10 hrs. or so to do multiplayer and all we get is errors. The game focus is more exploration than it is fishing, this is also a fishing game. So why did fishing come last in the order of importance. Their is absolutely no labeling of lakes or ponds names. So you have no clue where you are fishing at. Their are fishing challenges to do at certain places, but with no info you spend 4 hrs driving around instead of fast traveling and spending 4 hrs fishing.

Without the music it feels like you are really down there, alone with your thoughts and the sounds of the ocean. Being a big fan of the Abyss movie, I really liked the game a lot.

This game has so far exceeded all of my expectations. Granted, they weren't that low in the first place, but I now regret not giving this series a chance sooner.

Graphics are top notch, especially with the dynamic weather (which is unreal). The gameplay however is extremely challenging in my opinion.

In my favorite racing game of all time, Gran Turismo, even though it's a simulation, running into the occasional wall never completely hinders my race process. In Ride 5, the slightest collision or steep turn will cause you to fall off of your bike, which will more than not, cause you to lose that top spot. I appreciate this difficult yet realistic feature.

Bottom line, I really do love this game. It will take a lot more hours than I originally thought, but the graphics and overall feel are smooth combination for one of my favorite games of the year.","Sep 2, 2023",8

If that’s where the series is headed, it should eventually make for a more substantial experience than if Episode 5 is the full-stop end. The show won’t bend around to connect back to the game, as it’s over. Or is it? In any case, hopefully two more episodes will bring clarity to the limbo where The Expanse currently resides.

The game was smooth, and graphics were good; only a few minor flickers maybe once or twice an hour. The fights were smooth, fast, enjoyable and had many variations which was nice. Boss fights were quite diverse, which was a great change to many similar style games where boss fights become basically the same thing every time. I enjoyed the small puzzles as well, not so many it gets annoying and repetitive like many others. The story was different and unique, plus who doesn’t like magic! 

Some of the low ratings had nothing to do with the game itself, for example, not liking EA, or not wanting to call a female “sir”, or other such reasons.

The graphics are wonderful while the world is amazing and many times I just stand enjoying the view. Exploration is at its best and there are many activities and missions to do apart from the main quest. A very nice feature of the game is that the player can move by surfing on the sand. The combat is fantastic and for someone who looks for a challenge setting difficulty at hard is great. Also, by setting difficulty at hard the player is further incentivized to explore the magnificient world in order to find usefull resources to improve his skills. The story is very interesting and kept me looking for more. Overall, it is a fantastic game and one of the best ever in my opinion which I fully recommend.","Dec 10, 2023",6.0
1133,atlas fallen,PlayStation 5,Tesseract,User,"Another blatant example of how useless the gaming “journalism” has become. This is a game that knows it’s just a combination of better games - like it’s spiritual predecessor, Darksiders - and I love it for that reason. It isn’t trying to be some grandiose BS or act super duper serious. As one idiot critic says in their review, “Fine isn’t acceptable in 2023”, a tremendously stupid thing to say, particularly considering the insane level of irony having that come from a C-list website and someone part of an industry that keeps lowering its standards. But, alas, being good at a few different things but not reinventing the wheel is just not nearly good enough nowadays somehow. You’ve got to overcommit to one gimmick like most games with overly huge empty worlds and gloomy self-seriousness in order to be more than “Fine” these days. For me? No thanks.

The combat is great, the environments and movement are top tier, even the straightforward story isn’t as bad as some make it sound - it’s mostly a couple specific voice acting performances that are reeeeally bad. I had and am still having a blast playing Atlas Fallen. It has other little flaws but they’ve been repeated ad nauseam. So I’ll just say it’s probably a solid 7.5, maybe an 8 if you love the combat style. It isn’t a 10, but it absolutely isn’t a 2 or whatever, let alone a 0. Plastering “0” scores on things they haven’t experienced or overreacting to one particular thing they don’t like, is something cretins on this site love to do, so even though I don’t like just giving it a 10 to “balance it out”, there’s less than 40 scores right now and I feel I need to help get it closer to reality. I would hesitate buying it at full price only if you’re looking for a AAA package with the production and story at that level. Otherwise, if you want to just shut your brain off and fly around the place with sick traversal and old school PS2/PS3 style God of War-like combat, I say go for it.","Aug 15, 2023",10

2) The AI is intelligent and the difficulties are not just eye candy, they are what it is like. Cautious means that they take their time, slow build up using artillery and advancing slowly while aggressive AI will charge your lines, flank you, encircle you and destroy you.

3) You are rewarded for smart play as casualties carry over in the stages, enabling you to in or lose the battle on the first day of fighting.

1176,ultimate general gettysburg,PC,semperpietas,User,"This is a fun tactical game simulating the American Civil War. It has an easy learning curve, beautiful graphics, complex battlefield AI, and a beautiful art style to represent the largest battle of the American Civil War. Controls are fluid, even if picking exact units is a little troublesome, but the scale and depth is magnificent. Performance is awesome. There are hundreds of scenarios representing different parts of the famous three day battle and the nine AI settings all perform differently and competently. Combat is focused around infantry brigades firing volleys and batteries of artillery that can limber an artillery and the game features a line of sight system for what the player and his units can see. Infantry brigades are rated based on the unit's historical reputation and by a three star rating system (for instance, the famous Confederate Texas Brigade or the Union Irish Brigade are rated with three stars, while less reliable units like some of the Union Eleventh Corps brigades are rated only one star).

There are few historical quirks and rating differences I disagree with though. For instance, Union corps are labelled with Roman numerals, which is an anachronism for the period, and some generals like Richard Ewell of the Confederate 2nd Corps are rated as three stars, when I would argue that his performances would earn him a lower rater. Overall, however, these are minor and I found didn't detract from the gameplay experience.

The only gameplay negatives is that sometimes matches can drag on and there is a timing issue. There is no fast forward button, only pause and play. Pause is useful for micromanaging, but arranging attacks and waiting for units to march across the field can take a long time. If you wish to arrange an intricate assault with a lot of maneuvering, this will often eat into match time. The game is also limited to just the Gettysburg battle, though a future expansion with Antietam is being talked about.

However, these negatives are not overwhelming. By far, Ultimate General Gettysburg is an excellent, light, but intelligent title and recommended for Civil War Buffs and Strategy Fans.","Jun 24, 2015",10

1189,adore,Nintendo Switch,Hey Poor Player,Critic,"At the end of the day, though, that’s not the vision the developers had for Adore and that’s fine, as what they have produced is a damn fine spin on the monster taming genre all the same. Look past the repetition, and you’ll find that early simplicity was a complete red herring, as the complexities of team synergy, hidden passives, and the real-time combat suck you in. The core of what’s here is excellent, and while the narrow scope of the moment-to-moment gameplay loops may feel a little limiting, they allow the excellent core combat and surprising depth to shine through. If, like me, you were a little tired of the genre rehashing the same formula for what feels like forever, then Adore, while not without its flaws, will likely feel like a total breath of fresh air.","Aug 12, 2023",66

A lot to love here, from the retro attitude and light-hearted apocalypse of what the game refers to as New York City. I've also been loving the replay-ability of it, there are just enough roguelike elements to change things up each playthrough, and unlocking the many characters and learning their different move sets has been very satisfying. Game gives you a surprising amount of control over the difficulty- you can make it as easy as you like, but you'll get fewer tokens as a reward, which means taking longer to unlock additional characters and other easter eggs. Can't in good conscious give it a ten as it's missing a few things- namely network multiplayer and maybe a few more cutscenes - I want to see what all the unlockable characters do after saving/conquering the city, even if it's just a single still screen. Wouldn't mind a little more back-and-forth with the bosses as well. The game mechanics are generally great though the super moves are a little too easy to disrupt. That said, this is easily my favorite Double Dragon game, and I've been casually checking in and out of the franchise for decades.

1327,tangledeep,Nintendo Switch,Rizaloo,User,"I've been waiting for this release for well over a year.  Tempted by the PC version, I really wanted it on the go so I waited patiently.  Glad I did!  This is an absolutely fantastic rogue-like.  I love that they give you three difficulties, but on top of that, provide other tweaks you can do prior to starting a game to either increase or decrease the difficulty.   THe controls are perfect, although I'd love a way to ""mouse over"" icons such as skills to find out what they do.  That's my only quibble - this is a quality port of an excellent rogue-like with TONS of content, classes, pet raising, items.  Even fans of Diablo that don't mind turn-based approach would enjoy this.  Check out the steam user reviews; 9/10 on average, and I'm giving it a 10 to make up for the lad who bashed the game with clearly little understanding of what a rogue-like is.","Jan 31, 2019",7.7

It may have some little Bugs (most of them are only display wrong words after some events or wrong Icons) , but none of them is gamebreaking or even effecting game mechanic). And of top the developer is fixing them while bringing new content.

So if you want a challenging game with a complex System, beautiful retro design and nearly unlimited ways to individualize you're Gameplay (even every weapon plays differently), you should give it a try. And as a Bonus: there is a ton of different Items to loot.","Aug 29, 2019",9

The difficulty curve is balanced and each level is a good first level to be played, although, even if it's personal, some levels are slightly easier than some others. The game rewards exploration, allowing you to buy booster chips if you rescue civilians and you can even find health and energy upgrades. The music is spectacular. Every level has its own recognizable theme and every track is an absolute banger. This is what Mighty No. 9 should've been!","Nov 3, 2023",7.4
1469,gravity circuit,PC,PikaPhantom,User,"Outstanding game, possibly the best indie game I've ever played. The controls are largely fantastic, and the fast movement makes the game a visceral rush to play. The level design is strong. The presentation is refined, with some really lovely sprite work - despite the game largely adhering to limited color schemes for individual sprites, it's so high quality it leans towards feeling like a 16-bit styled game rather than an 8-bit one. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with a varied lineup of electronic songs (some calm, some very fast-paced). The story is strong as well, with numerous endgame twists that are executed well. While there are some minor gripes I have with elements of the controls and level design, and the game could've used a training room of some kind for experimenting with the new abilities you obtain, they aren't enough to stop me from giving this game a 10/10. There are few things more satisfying in any game than taking advantage of the hookshot grab to throw defeated enemies at others. Genuine shame the game hasn't received more attention, because it could be a genuine contender for Indie Game of the Year. It might even end up being my game of the year overall!","Aug 21, 2023",10

The pacing respects the long history players have had with these characters to deliver a narrative that respects fans. This isn’t a game for those who haven’t played the previous titles, as it addresses overlooked plot points and relationships that could spoil those games. It doesn’t bog down progression with feeble recaps and instead marches ever onward with confidence.

1520,the legend of heroes trails into reverie,PlayStation 5,AdoMobA,User,"Pros
- a beautiful epilogue to the first three arcsthe cross-story feature works great to gate story progress in certain points
- the biggest playable cast in the series (51 characters that are fully customizable)
- plethora of post game content that will keep you playing
- the daydreams (reminiscent of the doors from Trails in the Sky the 3rd) give exciting glimpses into the lives of our favorite characters
- the addition of the Abyssal difficulty and the options to increase enemy levels by 50 or 100 allows the gameplay to remain engaging
Cons
- the lack of voice acting makes some of the games more pivotal moments feel way less epic than they could have been
- the controls for Project Tyrfing minigame are god awful

The tenth game in the Trails series is an optionally massive game. From the amount of content, to the story significance and some quite bold directions the story goes, Trails into Reverie takes the training wheels off and relies on you playing all the previous games. And it feels fantastic.
The story is interesting from start to finish, using everything and everyone you met through the Sky, Crossbell and Cold Steel arcs of this series. It also takes some of the previously established concepts and takes them in such a direction that nobody could predict yet it feels right. And the emotional one, two punch that is the ending for the main story left me with a smile on my face and a wash of new excitement for the next arc.
But the main story ending does not mean the game is over. Through the introduction of the Reverie Corridor, you are offered a section of the game mostly focused on the gameplay, offering a plethora of post game content to lose hours to. Gameplay that never gets boring thanks to the introduction of the United Front attacks and the frankly absurd cast hosting 51 characters from all the previous arcs.
Outside of the outstanding Trails combat, the Reverie Corridor also offers previously unseen amounts of minigames and daydreams. All of these offer glimpses into past and future events, giving you an idea of what certain individuals have been up to since their arcs concluded. What is exciting in particular are the two daydreams received in the Post Game, where you are offered a glimpse into the future arc.
All in all, Reverie quickly climbed to be one of my favorite games in the series, owing that fact to its bold story and the sheer amount of characters it lets you play. Reverie not being an entry game allows it to shed some of the burdens of having to reintroduce concepts in each game and allows it to soar to ever greater heights.","Oct 21, 2023",7.9

1677,story of seasons a wonderful life,Nintendo Switch,SeanD,User,"It's a pretty faithful reimagining of an old classic. It adds a few things (more crops, for example) and subtracts others(animal health), but is overall a very enjoyable experience.

While some old HM fans might be disappointed at some of the (very few) omissions, they were clearly mostly done as QoL changes to make the experience less grindy and more streamlined. The main criticism of the game from critics is that it is too slow by 2023 standard, and that is in spite of these changes. So it's understandable why these changes were made in the first place as otherwise the game would feel even slower. But mostly it is a very calm and cozy affair with no glaring flaws to speak of.

However, it is disappointing to see that some with radical extremist views are review-bombing this game with wholly unjustified 0/10 scores simply because it expands on the original by providing more character choices. There's no pandering, no-tokenism, no in-your-face grandstanding show of diversity, nothing is shoved down anybody's throat. It literally just allows people to express themselves in a manner that fits them without substracting anything from anybody else's experience.

Of course, the original game was from a time where minority voices were not given as much importance as they are now, and it seems like some people are just much too 'nostalgic' of those times. Clearly, to the privileged, equality feels like oppression. I worry about the mental and physical health of these 'concerned' individuals and that of their children and other family members as well.

1678,story of seasons a wonderful life,Nintendo Switch,Undeadbobop,User,"This game deserves far better scores I can not even begin to state what a master peice the orignal was and the added same-sex marriage and non-binary options are only the cherry on top. I looked over the reviews that are negative, they are not worth reading and they do not belong on this site as they go into hate-speech and claim my existence is politics, they are all extremist biggots who would kill me and others like me if given the chance and use their religion and politics to justify it. I am pan and non-binary.  I found the representation to be accurate, a slight alteration on the source material in some parts such as character names, designs, and a slight altering of morning after clear depiction of after sex in the source material was not here, a lot of small translation fixes as the original port studio did a poor job of translating in the original and there was a lot of engrish.  This game left me with dysphoria in the best of ways. I would happily recommend this game over the original as it has improved in literally every way with the small changes they did make and the original was a masterpiece in itself.  The original every farm/date sim tried to capture the lightening from again after and all of them even future Story of Seasons/Harvest moon games just well couldn't for me. This was the best remake **** I have ever seen and I love it. When I heard it was out I threw Friendship of mineral town out of my switch, rushed to the store and bought it while on vacation miles appart from any store. If you want to talk about politics I would love to talk about how in friendship of mineral town pushes so hard on the church. Keep your religion to yourselves I have cookies. In all seriousness friendship of mineral town tried shoving that church down your throats by requiring you to interact with it, in this game you are not required to be non-binary, you are not required to have same-sex marriage, and none of the characters in the main cast are. I do wish one of them was non-binary but I can understand why they didn't take this route. I am allowing my children to play this game after I am done with it. The only scenes censored in it involved after sex scene, so if that is your complaint and your complaint is also about you thinking its a kids game, then those two things don't make any sense.","Jul 25, 2023",10

It takes a while to get going, though it also makes familiarizing yourself with its somewhat dense lore easy thanks to a built-in codex that explains most of the in-world jargon required to understand what’s going on.
