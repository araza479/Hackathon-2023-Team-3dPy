I was told that it could be in the second update. I brought to their attention that I couldn‚Äôt find any other game on the list that wasn‚Äôt on sale they just told me to wait for the second update. It is now the second update and Job Simulator is still not on sale. I reached out to Sony today to ask why it‚Äôs listed if it‚Äôs not on sale. I was told I should reach out to the game publisher. I was confused as to what the game publisher was going to tell me about a game Sony listed for sale. It was so funny to me that I even attempted to role play with the agent. I said I would be the game publisher and with he being me, show what I‚Äôm supposed to tell the game publisher and how they‚Äôre supposed to help. Honestly I came here to just see if they had updated the list because I thought it would have just been easier to make an edit. To my surprise I see the blog has been updated to say the store has its second wave update but Job Simulator is still listed. It also made me feel like a heel when I noticed that they stopped recognizing the PlayStation stars level. I thought it was a customer loyalty program. To achieve top tier status and no acknowledgment from all four reps, two handled in text and two on the phone, despite its advertisement as a perk, made me feel like a fool. It was my desire to make this private but there‚Äôs no email to address customer service. I also didn‚Äôt get that survey I requested from two different agents. I was assured it would be emailed to me at the end of the call. Never got that email.

The games are as follows: Heaven‚Äôs Vault, Tumbleseed, and Nuclear Throne.

This is a no brainer upgrade and one of the best co op / online co op games available on the platform. 2 runs at 60fps on ps5 For arcade and family Hotwheels game of the year (or base) are both great and are 85% off first wll time low on goty. Im considering selling-trading our physical copy towards the goty at $24cad, goty expansion pass is more expensive and typically they remain this way. Superb technically on ps5 and 2 player local also. The smoking deal is divisive however. Anthem 97% off and not the bogus inflated price one the base, do if you have no cash, like shooters and iron man you might find a couple bucks gets you something for christmas. If you told me years ago that Bioware would have a top budget game on sale on the psn 97% off i would have laughed, but here it is. Let‚Äôs see if they can turn it around with the next Dragon Age. Thanks EA for your ‚Äúmidas‚Äù touch. Theres other stuff that‚Äôs ok, but it‚Äôs very repetitive and worse than physical largely. For the guy whining about Eldin Ring digital sale, here it is, that is decent if you have a digital only ps5, otherwise it was on for cheaper physical black friday and its on again this boxing week etc for cheaper physical so i don‚Äôt consider it a great deal in this sale. Titles you cannot buy physical at all time lows or digital only at all time lows are real deals. Or early large discounts, gotham would be one at half off but that game is gruel, when we asked for pizza, why buy that for 30usd when you can buy arkham 3 game all dlc collection for 9usd. Thats it.

Stuff does well it keeps price and perceived value January is new models of goods by design, and holiday shifts excess. Price and value are variable, perceived value and sell through, over time, growth is a curve on underperforming goods you have options like trying price reduction for higher volume. Margin and volume. If you guys learn about this stuff you can see and understand the trends better. Nintendo and Disney understand they have high value because of children. Men buy at any time so are catered to bigger longer spends in gaming, children value ip highly and want longer play value they often have to wait for special occasions to get games. This is how it is. Cod never went on sale in the past, because it was top. Same with Mario Pok√©mon etc because it‚Äôs kids. I can safely pickup Pok√©mon Scarlet etc today in that knowledge.

I got pretty bored with the last half of God Of War 2018 and never placed it since 2018. My next game is Elden Ring but trying to buy that game Brand new  for PS4 is a nightmare. Its lowest price is ¬£49.99. I want it on Physical Disc but I may have to give in and buy the Digital version from the store. My next game after Elden Ring will be Resident Evil 4 which I will buy on launch day for sure, I can‚Äôt wait for that one.
