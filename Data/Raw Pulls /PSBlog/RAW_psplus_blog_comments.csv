87,HeroicPower,"December 7, 2023 at 10:43 am PST","Fourth, lastly. There seems to be some hostilities within Bungie and Sony with the recent departure/firing of the company. You should be hiring some of those productive talents within other studios at PlayStation unless they really don‚Äôt like the company. You could make another studio next to Bungie and give them incentives to work for that newly made studio to make exclusive shooters, while having higher pays and bonuses if they deliver a great first party exclusive shooter.  Giving them the choice to go to that studio rather than having any form of hostility with Bungie directly. Bungie lied about their numbers, they were not worth the 3 billion dollars, they were at most worth half of what you paid for Insomniac. Nevertheless, their talent is needed, they should not be overseeing other studios‚Äô multi-player projects because they want to make their own game their own way.Like the Last of Us Multiplayer game. But reassure them that you do care about Bungie and their employees, you just require a profitability, ROI, and that you support whichever choice and what platform they want to make games for at Bungie and support their choice to be included in a new studio for an exclusive shooter project. It is always hard choices and heart breaking when decisions have to be made to cut staff.Had Bungie heads be more transparent, you would have acquired them but probably for much less. It i what it is, we can‚Äôt go back on it. Fifth.  Just Acquire Square-Enix, before they release FF7 Rebirth. That‚Äôs a worthwhile investment.There‚Äôs plenty of other smaller studios ready to be first party studios.  Former FF15 studio is one of them too who went independent.  Have Sony make the acquisition so that Square-Enix have the ability to make Nintendo properties if needed.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/11/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-december-lego-2k-drive-powerwash-simulator-sable/

SC: Broken Destiny was one of them. The best version of Street Fighter Alpha 3 was on PSP, as was that awesome Darkstalkers compilation. Some of the Guilty Gear ports from PSP would be nice on PS+, too. Beyond fighters, PSP just had so many exclusive gems ‚Äì often updates or remixes of existing games, but still, it would be great to have more on the modern consoles. Mega Man Powered Up, Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, Power Stone Collection, a couple of oddball Sonic games.

457,ApexTurtle77,"October 11, 2023 at 9:55 am PDT","So where is this increase in value and quality then? The increase in PS Plus tier price was so that Sony could give us more quality content. What is this content that they are talking about? Sony Pictures Core, the streaming service that you either need to buy/rent movies from or get a curated selection by subscribing to the highest sub tier where they are not even adding quality classic games? Or maybe it‚Äôs Gotham Knights which is on sale right for 20 pounds (in UK) and which reviewed terribly. Could it be GunGrave Gore, which is completely abysmal? Alien Isolation which was released in 2014 and has had such low sale prices, you could buy it for peanuts? Don‚Äôt get me started on the other games‚Ä¶ While Disco Elysium is a good offering, I would argue that it is very niche and since it‚Äôs been out for quite some time, every interested party has already bought it. It‚Äôs time to look at quality versus how much the game retails for. Give us some day one/recent indie games like the new Long Gone Days (which incidentally is only 50 pence more expensive than discounted Gotham Knights), or some at least some games that have been well received and are not older than a few years. A good indie is worth 2 bad AAAs.

I was this close to buying it but held off assuming it would be ‚Äúthe next month‚Äù or ‚Äúthe month after‚Äù. Unlike Calisto Protocol‚Äôs special situation, I can assume that most games (1st party or not), have to wait a year before hitting the catalog. I‚Äôll remember that for the future, because Gotham Knights seriously needed a boost all year. My friends loved the game but with Suicide Squad so close, and storage space tight (thanks for the 667 gb btw‚Ä¶.), I really didn‚Äôt want to buy it when I have so many other games to play or work on. Yeah, I‚Äôm holding out for the mid-gen PS5 next fall. I refuse to buy more storage until then. Lots of other great spooky titles too, I put off Alien Isolation for almost a decade after not picking it up on Black Friday in 2015 (bought a bunch of games that I still never finished to this day). Also I was excited for Tekken 6 except I quickly realized it‚Äôs just the PSP port probably. I rented the PS3 game from blockbuster and loved it back in the day but never ended up buying it unfortunately. I wish I did. It always kind of haunted me.

Like seriously, is this supposed to be the latest gen console or an overpriced, cheaply made Atari emulator with an absurdly small drive space practically designed to barely hold one single current gen game. Oh and shall we also discuss how you refuse to refund purchases of games that you‚Äôre still selling that aren‚Äôt (and never will be) complete due to the companies that made them going bankrupt? Or maybe how the (shady) primary necessity for your $120+ Edge controllers is because you deliberately made your default controllers to experience stick drift, etc so gamers have to choose to keep replacing the $75 default ones constantly or to buy a $125+ Edge one and still have to pay $20 per ONE SINGLE analog stick replacements, when they‚Äôll eventually wear out as well. Or maybe even perhaps the mind-bogglingly absurd decision to charge $60 just to change the color of the oversized plastic console plates that are worth $20 at best. Or maybe you‚Äôd prefer to have a laugh over how you had the audacity to charge $100 for that cheaply made ‚ÄúBackbone‚Äù (that Nintendo did better with its HandyBoy in the ‚Äô90s). And all this while charging $70-75 per game on top of an already $500 console? And do we really even need to mention how badly you dropped the ball by letting Xbox snatch up most of the greatest game publishing companies? Like seriously, what cards do you hold at this point to justify such a steep PS Plus price hike? Not a single one. You‚Äôre trying to go all-in on a bluff meanwhile everyone knows you have nothing in your hand but big talk, straight up lies, poor choices and cheaply made accessories but go ahead, by all means push your already overcharged and under-appreciated PS gamers over to Xbox even faster. Ya might wanna can whoever is making these ridiculous decisions. Cause if we didn‚Äôt know better (or at least assume better), one would almost suspect someones trying to fund a really bad üëÉüç¨ habit with even more bad decisions rather than trying to elevate what was once a gaming industry juggernaut to a whole new level, better than ever before. Between you and TakeTwo/Rockstar making some of the worst choices I‚Äôve ever seen companies make‚Ä¶at this point, I‚Äôm starting to think you‚Äôre both actually trying (and succeeding) to sink your companies, once and for all.

If it was an exception to put the same game in both tiers I would shut up, but they do it almost every month. And Essential tier is getting worse and worse, I convinced some friends of mine to subscribe it months ago, they are not satisfied at all and will not renew it. If they enjoyed it maybe they would have considered upgrading to a higher tier instead. This is what you get if you don‚Äôt give quality to your basic subscription. Actually SIE is making a terrible job and please don‚Äôt tell me that Essential is mainly intended for going online, it‚Äôs 2023 and online service should be free on consoles too.

Best purchase I‚Äôve made in years. Although it HAS been years. They‚Äôre basically giving everyone a free license to use it which is astounding given that it‚Äôs ending live support for the game in preparation of MM‚Äôs next project. That‚Äôs not a bad thing, there‚Äôs tons of content in Dreams as is although making it is a whole other beast. I at least hope this spurs some creative minds. Deaths door I heard was good I think and yeah another 2K golf game is so pointless. We got one years ago right? (in August too..).

If you have time to play and complete all these games, if so your trophy collection must be so much! I play some titles each month and either don‚Äôt have time to complete them, forget that I have them in my collection and then I loose interest. For example, Back 4 Blood is a great game, I played and got half way through the story and just lost interest.No doubt, I think PS plus is a good service for us gamers and I have the premium which will expire this winter. I might switch to the Extra for next year.Anyways I am curious about all these titles from your point of view. =)",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-classics-for-july-it-takes-two-sniper-elite-5-twisted-metal/

We‚Äôre currently testing cloud streaming for supported PS5 games ‚Äì this includes PS5 titles from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and Game Trials, as well as supported digital PS5 titles that players own. When this feature launches, cloud game streaming for supported PS5 titles will be available for  use directly on your PS5 console. That means as a Premium member, it‚Äôll be easier to jump into your favorite games without downloading them first onto your PS5 console. Our goal is to add this as an additional benefit to PlayStation Plus Premium as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the value of PlayStation Plus. ‚Äù I still remember back in the PS Now days, Sony‚Äôs marketing would say ‚ÄúStream games over PS Now, no downloads required‚Äù. Then later they finally realized their streaming wasn‚Äôt very good and gave the option to download PS Now games. It‚Äôs nice to have options, but I‚Äôd rather they focus on optimizing PS3 game streaming if they have no plans to actually deal with native emulation.

Hassan is obsessed with plus and posting lists of the almighty Sorny value gods of games raining the good life on us plebs. They are not paid as often he has had his posts scrubbed. He can do so at his will if he follows their tos. For those that find it obnoxious just scroll past the ‚Äúads‚Äù In the past he was primarily obsessed with trophy counts, and value of games were celebrated on that. The grandiose Sony is saviour stuff they have toned down, so honestly skip the lists or don‚Äôt. Grapeshack it absolutely does matter if someone is paid to advert and it is the case it needs to be disclosed, youtube / twitch etc. For those claiming you can still access the ‚Äúnow‚Äù tier removals you absolutely cannot, i have verified this on my own ps5, and another point on essential i also still have tranformers devastation and can access from essential years ago.

1659,CommandingTiger,"April 7, 2023 at 10:09 am PDT","Hey PS. What are you thinking about this new ‚ÄúQ Lite‚Äù handheld system? If it‚Äôs just going to be a remote play device, just put out remote play on more Android devices and the Vita and call it a day. Either way, you need to port Remote play on PS5, the PS Vita can remote play the PS4 and there‚Äôs no reason to do the same with the PS5.If it‚Äôs remote play only, then it‚Äôs DOA. It needs full PS4 and PS5 compatibility/emulation but at a lower performance. I don‚Äôt think you heard me correctly. That system only made sense as a ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù controller with Remote Play ability with s bigger battery.That controller would add additional features and functions inside each PS5 exclusive games like inventory management, additional buttons actions, scope shooting zoom in vision for shooters, puzzle solving, RTS ‚ÄúStrategy games‚Äù selecting troops, etc. It would be better than just a touch pad It would require software and hardware to save on battery greatly, keep the screen off most of the time for a better battery efficiency and a much bigger battery. This system only makes sense in a hybrid Handheld/Home console system. Where instead of ‚Äúremoving the joycons‚Äù, it keeps all of it‚Äôs component, but removes the main system console chip, while keeping the little sister system for smaller tasks and functions. The main system would also have it‚Äôs own dock that would connect to the TV as well as connection itself to additional SSD memory and Blu Ray drive. You can make a Ryzen console with 16Gb of Ram similar to a mobile device like the Asus ROG Ally handheld with more power than the Steam Deck that would rival and surpass the Xbox Series S (since it has more Ram) meaning it would make it easy for third party games to port the game over that if it‚Äôs on Xbox Series S, then it has to release on this handheld system. With Ryzen architecture, it makes it significantly easier to port the games over to the handheld. You would just scale down on this handheld for 1080p, 30fps to 60fps. If you can run Horizon Zero Dawn on the Steam Deck, you can run Forbidden West on a stronger Handheld.It‚Äôs not like with the Vita using an outdated ARM mobile chip with low Ram like the PS3. The architecture is significantly too different and under-powered. This ‚ÄúQ Lite‚Äù would have a dock behind the console to sit the main console board. You‚Äôre still releasing PS4 games and handhelds are now much stronger than a PS4 now. It would also feature Blue-tooth to connect to a PS5 or the handheld in dock mode. If you are just releasing this system as a remote play only controller, then there is 0 appeal and would be a waste of money for everyone, don‚Äôt waste your money.People can already remote play on their phone and that‚Äôs fine enough.The way it‚Äôs being described, I‚Äôd have to says that it is DOA and won‚Äôt sell well. You need the whole package.You need to be able to play your PS5 games on the go (and PS4) while lower specs obviously. It still needs 16Gb of Ram to avoid any memory issues like TLOU P! on PC.Easy to port, mass appeal in Japan. People want a real handheld and it won‚Äôt affect the PS5‚Äôs graphics at all, just the resolution and fps. It won‚Äôt be having dedicated studios making handheld only games, but rather a handheld that emulates all PS4 and runs PS5 games. There‚Äôs way too many handheld consoles to miss out on the growing market. Also use SD, USB memory, M.2 SSD or traditional type of memory. NO SONY OWNED MEMORY CARDS! They‚Äôre too expensive and don‚Äôt protect games.Blu-Ray games will need to be scanned once every 4 months or accessed via your PS5 from home to confirm you own that game for disc games.Your efforts to port games on this handheld will be significantly easier than those to port PS5 games to the wide array of PCs running on Windows with DX12.Be smart and it‚Äôll be a success. The ‚ÄúQ Lite‚Äù must have an OLED with Sony back HDR color calibration options for the screen.It needs replaceable battery similar to the PSP for longevity. By all means, don‚Äôt just send this as a controller with a screen, have it be a hybrid device console that plays PS4/PS5 games and run PS4 games as a PS4 pro mode. If the Q Lite also has an ARM chip, for whatever reason, then it should play PSP/Vita games too. If that‚Äôs the case. Remote play don‚Äôt always connect as most jobs and public areas legit block access to do so. So it would be absolutely pointless to release this without making it a console as well.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/03/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-april-meet-your-maker-sackboy-a-big-adventure-tails-of-iron/

You play them and you move on. Most of the vita stuff people are salty over were plus adds so you aren‚Äôt even down on ps3 or vita for glorified rentals anyways. Lastly this is why you buy physical as much as possible. Every big title on my son‚Äôs switch is physical, and you make that purchase digitally on ps5 or ps4 back compatibility that if you don‚Äôt have working hardware in x years it‚Äôll be potentially inaccessible. I don‚Äôt get the complaining on this especially on ps3. I still have mine and i sold the vita on. They never promised us we could play 1995 on or psn account on in perpetuity.

Colors look too drab like everything is rusty and I hate building.Had some hope for the AAA game but of course it had to be one I own again (at least last month‚Äôs BF2042 brought in some new players so I could finally manage to get my hazard zone trophies and platinum the game). Never even heard of the third game but I‚Äôll probably skip due to flat 2D graphics that give it a mobile look. I see someone commenting ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy that every month I get at least 1 thing from my wishlist‚Äù. That must be nice, it‚Äôs the opposite for me. It‚Äôs crazy how this service manages to disappoint me so frequently and consistently, and I get to pay for that privilege!

1705,Stonesthrow,"April 1, 2023 at 1:42 am PDT","Good question! I buy most games I‚Äôm slightly interested in and prefer physical for preservation. My favorites were Puppeteer, Plague Tale and Control because I didn‚Äôt get around to getting them, and also didn‚Äôt really mind not owning them permanently on disc. On top of that none of them had large download sizes, a major factor for me so as to avoid lag (I still don‚Äôt get why they‚Äôd want to combine online access with a service that has you downloading games regularly and ruining your bandwidth..). My second favorites were games I decided to give a try and really enjoyed. Mercenary Kings, 2064 Read Only Memories, Concrete Genie, Man Eater and Horizon Chase Turbo. That‚Äôs about it for my list of 253 PS+ games that I added (sub since it‚Äôs mandatory for online, so since PS4), other than a handful of small games I tried and deleted right after (but still earning a trophy or two so they‚Äôre permanently on my trophy list, discouraging me from trying PS+ games even more) and a few AAA games I‚Äôm still holding off of that get pushed back due to size.My comment was perhaps too harsh in that moment of disappointment (wish we still had an edit function) and I do  believe the selections have gotten slightly better since the new tiers got introduced (contrary to my beliefs, let‚Äôs hope it stays that way) and I realize I‚Äôm hard to please :) Objectively I think this is a great line-up.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/03/29/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-april-meet-your-maker-sackboy-a-big-adventure-tails-of-iron/

Life is Strange : True Colors I‚Äôll pick up too. Best game for me right now that seems reasonable (maybe a bit new but it‚Äôs already on sale) that I probably wouldn‚Äôt buy but am still interested in trying would be Marvel Midnight Suns.

You can play new games 10hours before they come out , fifa 23 when on here?????? Some stuff value to play it earlier. Multiplayer games with mtx passes expansions etc are massively in sony and that companies ea in this case favour to jam on plus. This list only requires a few games to be worth a fiver to the right person. I dislike EA disgustingly greedy company but the month option is fair, the annual is not. Plus essential ruling out the ps5 igc often is monthly blanks with games you have no interest in whatsoever. If you don‚Äôt get value, don‚Äôt buy it simple. I‚Äôll throw $5 at play n the fall to try some of the new games, if i like any it‚Äôs %10 off which more than recoups the 5.

I enjoy campaigns, such as BF1, BF4, BF5 and BF Hardline, which Battlefield 2042 lacks. But after trying this, i found the online play is actually not bad and you should get a few goid hours out of this. Minecraft Dungeons is a pretty cool dungeon crawler. It will not wow anyone with its basic functions but overall,  this is fun with decent combat.This too is worth sinking a few hours into. Finally, Code Vein is a good selection, as it‚Äôs an anime title with combat reminiscent of a Dark Souls like game.

It‚Äôs downright unfair how the loyalty program is penalising the players that have been the most loyal. There‚Äôs zero logic there. Based on how the campaigns haven‚Äôt been dished out right  so far (and the endless number of people complaining on Reddit/Twitter) it seems like Sony is covering it‚Äôs back here instead of making Stars work right.

Does anyone else find this insulting? Game prices are 80 euro minimum, people paying this much deserve 3years MINIMUM before it goes to subscription AND 5+ years before it goes to PC. The PC ports have NOT been doing well and teh subscriptions will not grow much more, you are essentially at a ceiling‚Ä¶.. you are also in a loop where you wont grow console sales much because you put exclusives on PC and therefore you cannot increase the roof on subscriptions. So youve really hurt yourselves with this one‚Ä¶you‚Äôll only see marginal growth. The other issue is that you cannot model for this in excel spreadsheets, so analysts have limited value. You can only model a relatively linear question in isolation‚Ä¶. not something as complicated as console growth / health when so many differing factors / inputs have to be considered.

The Evil Dead: The Game on PS4, PS5 is a cool game, as I‚Äôve tried it. It got decent metacritic ratings.  Since it‚Äôs in a crowded kill the zombies type of game. It‚Äôll need to stand out to get some playing time, as I have the Last of Us 1 and 2, Dead Rising 1 and 2, Dying Light 2, World War Z, and Back 4 Blood,  for example.  So I‚Äôm unsure how much play this‚Äôll get but it‚Äôs a good psn selection, as it‚Äôs worth trying. I‚Äôm looking forward to OlliOlliWorld on PS4, PS5. This is another good psn selection, as I‚Äôve otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have picked it up.  As a former skater, I love the skater games like Tony Hawk and Skater XL. OlliOlli is not a skateboard simulator but it still looks like a blast and it received good ratings on metacritic. Destiny 2: Beyond Light on PS4, PS5. I‚Äôve had several games from this series but I fell off playing this after Foresaken so this provides an opportunity to play this solid well done title again. Mafia: The Definitive Edition on PS4. I have Mafia 3 which was a psn game. It‚Äôs a fun open world so this game will be worth sinking a few hours in. Thanks Sony.

How can you launch a classic tier driven offering without making sure you have the emulators in place to play the games?  I‚Äôve been emulating both PS2 and PS3 on PC and they work amazingly well.  Heck, my Steam Deck runs the classic tier games better than my PS5 does at this point.  That‚Äôs unacceptable.  Until Sony fixes the abysmal emulators they have, I can‚Äôt pay for Premium.  I‚Äôll happily stay on the Plus tier.  I might give Extra a go because there are some games I‚Äôve been interested in trying.

2289,treos100,"December 29, 2022 at 1:50 pm PST","Fallout 76‚Ä¶from the fallout wiki (consider this a USER BEWARE): Fast traveling to anywhere at the exact time another player joins the fast traveling player‚Äôs public team can cause the game to freeze after showing a second loading slide, then freezing at the Vault-Tec auto-save screen. Disconnecting and trying to rejoin the team or waiting to join a new server cannot fix this. Solution: Sign in as another of your player characters, log out immediately, and try the bugged character again, even after waiting a few minutes. This fixes the problem. Trying to load up a character after putting the PS4 in Rest Mode for some time can result in the game crashing due to corrupt application data. Solution: Follow the on-screen suggestion, delete the application data, and reinstall it from the disc. Be advised, doing so also carries the penalty of losing all photos in the Photo Gallery, removing pre-set NW Favorites for weapon paints and clothing, selected loot bag, and dealing with the hassle of updating the game to the latest version again. Warning: If this happens more than once, it might be that the disc has become damaged, rendering the installation data corrupt so it only works for a short while before needing to be reinstalled again. The only solution is to buy a new copy of the physical disc, or attempt to download the data from online if the game was bought online instead, without the physical disc. Fast traveling or walking towards locations such as Kiddie Corner Cabins or Poseidon Energy Plant yard from certain angles can cause the game to crash. Reloading at the spawn point after restarting the game resets the bug for some time before it can happen again. If the game crashes while in the middle of a Daily Op, be it having just joined it, working it, or finishing it, but not having left it yet, or freezes during the auto-save screen with the Vault-Tec logo in the lower right corner, forcing a player to quit and restart the game application to undo it, it causes the frame rate when using the inventory HUD for anything, stash boxes, vendors, Legendary exchange machine, etc., to lag considerably, causing slow response from the game for any actions done with the DualShock 4 controller for several seconds. Solution: The lag clears up, but it takes some time, and can take several days before things return to normal and the frame rate recovers to more favorable levels, at least until the bug happens again to cause the player more frustration and grief. ‚Äî i ignored this game when you added it to ps+ extra and i am not going to download it now because i do not want a bethesda game that modders cannot fix FOR bethesda! and that is a FACT: modders are the bug testers/fixers of bethesda games, NOT bethesda themselves!",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-fallout-76-axiom-verge-2/

I do not normally comment, but I would like to add my opinion:I think PS Plus is at the moment the best option, especially for new players, if they get a Playstation for the first time, this is the best option: at the moment there are loads of fantastic games, triple A and Inde games. Hours and hours of gameplay. Personally, in my case, I was lucky to have the mains economically to be able to purchase some of these titles already, however there are awesome games for those who haven‚Äôt had the chance to purchase them. I have PS Plus Premium (because I had PS Now and PS Plus previously), and I am thinking to renew it next year, because I can play streaming those games I could not purchase in the past. I use the subscription, it is worthy for me. But if you think it is not for you, simply, do not buy it. I am PSPlus subscriber from day 1, then I stopped my subscription years later because I simply did not like the monthly games line up for several months. Simple. At the moment, for me, the PS Plus game catalog is absolutely fantastic; I am 45 years old, 25 years gamer, and in my opinion, at this time, it is my best time enjoying games with PS plus. And I would like to add, that I have had Game Pass Ultimate too, but I stopped my subscription: I can‚Äôt stop playing with my awesome PS5.",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/11/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-lineup-for-november-skyrim-rainbow-six-siege-kingdom-hearts-iii-and-more/

It‚Äôs just a shame that several of the games he listed are PS3 titles that can only be played via streaming, which is a sub-par experience even at its best. And I‚Äôm sure there were other titles he was forced to omit because they‚Äôre simply not available on PS5. I understand that emulation is very complicated, but the massive and beloved PS2 and PS3 catalogs are mostly absent and it leaves a great void on the modern PlayStation platform. For one, PS2 emulation should be a lot better than it is. During the PS3 era, Sony released many remastered collections of the best PS2 titles, which are still the definitive versions today. To a lesser extent, we saw a similar effort for PS3 games on PS4, but there is still so much missing. I think it would be a great success if PS could renew this program and remaster (not remake) SIE‚Äôs acclaimed PS3 games, including the aforementioned PS2 collections. I would actually prefer this over emulation and would buy the games again. Streaming from remote PS3 servers just doesn‚Äôt cut it and isn‚Äôt sustainable. Not to mention that in the era of 60fps performance, games running at sub-30 are difficult to tolerate. Also, PS3s and Dualshock 3s are failing, so we will soon have no way to access that incredible library.

2809,iamtylerdurden1,"October 12, 2022 at 11:14 am PDT","They added more than 1. Dino Crisis, Ridge Racer, Resistance Retribution etc are coming. True classics have been sparse but there are other aspects that add value. Yakuza 3-5 Remastered have been ignored by everyone. Streaming has actually improved and the PS3 library is extensive. LoS indeed is fantastic. Trials will continue to be added. Premium is $1.80 per month essentially and the service is new. It‚Äôll take time. The lack of psp is outrageous imo. Titles like Peace Walker, Daxter, Clank games, KZ Liberation would be great. So i understand the frustration but i also know that ppl spotlight the weakest aspect (psp/ps1) and ignore the rest of the perks. I see both sides and if ppl were honest i‚Äôd be more critical but they aren‚Äôt. Most act like the PS3 library, remasters, and trials don‚Äôt exist. Ppl also ignore the minimal price and the fact the service is new and will take time. And if u say u pay per month thus the cost of extra is not cheap then u are either stupid or your gripe is irrelevant bc u can obviously not sub to premium next month.

You‚Äôve wildly overvalued those additions. Until you can properly add native PS3 emulation, there is nothing Premium about a mediocre streaming experience. PlayStation Now wasn‚Äôt popular for a reason. It still isn‚Äôt popular. If anything getting a few streaming games falls under Essential or Extra. Real classics with updated Trophy support brought forward is what people want, clearly. You get native PS3 emulation with Trophy support moved forward to PS5; Now you‚Äôre talking Premium. However someday if you get that done, you‚Äôll probably just add a 4th tier and charge $160 a year because PlayStation loves being for the players.",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/10/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-lineup-for-october-grand-theft-auto-vice-city-the-definitive-edition-dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age/
2811,iamtylerdurden1,"October 12, 2022 at 12:20 pm PDT","U can gripe about the lack of psp, ps1, ps2 for the brand new service but don‚Äôt  exaggerate like a child. ‚Äúa few ps3 games‚Äù The service has over 300 PS3 games last i checked. More PS3 games than Gamepass has games and i have Gamepass. If u subbed to premium with the expectation of native PS3 then u are foolish. Like the ppl expecting games like God of War and Spiderman day 1. Btw, the streaming is on par with Gamepass. Streaming is a perk from the $1.80 per month extra fee u spend, not the focus. Streaming will never be close to native. Not yet at least. Accept it. It‚Äôs at least improved over early PSNow and with a low latency tv, good connection, on game mode it‚Äôs still worth exploring the vast ps3 library. ‚ÄúPSNow still isn‚Äôt popular‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚Äústreaming should fall under essential and extra‚Äù Essential is the exact price and content that PS+ was previously. $5 per month. They should open 300 free PS3 games to everyone at no extra cost? U make no sense. Stop saying ‚Äúa few PS3 games‚Äù it truly feels like u believe the monthly PS3 additions are THE ONLY games in the Premium PS3 catalogue. That‚Äôs the problem with the internet, the uninformed vocal minority screaming about subjects that they have zero knowledge on and don‚Äôt affect them. U don‚Äôt have extra or premium‚Ä¶do u? Because u don‚Äôt know what u are talking about. Use Google  at least. ‚Äúreal classics updated with trophy support is what ppl want‚Äù They have real classics updated with trophy support. Not enough but they have them. It‚Äôs literally a thing rn. If in the future emulation was added and the price increased to $160 it would still be cheaper than Gamepass and i enjoy Gamepass but it‚Äôsstill the truth. Are u insinuating that the tiers are overpriced? Extra is $80 less than Gamepass about $8 per on a yearly. Premium is 120 and $10 per at $60 less than GPU. Essential is the same as always, 60 aka $5 per. Pretty reasonable imo. Sony has had some greedy practices but PS+ aint it. Just be honest. Tired of liars pushing agendas. I prefer Sony but i enjoy Gamepass as well. I‚Äôm pro PlayStation but i don‚Äôt have to twist the truth. Everyone i respond to is lying by omission or outright. I‚Äôm reacting to the narrative rather than shilling for a brand. If ppl/media were honest i wouldn‚Äôt need to balance things out. Just be honest. Extra is great value, Premium lacks true classics atm but both are still fair. Rn Premium might not be the best option for most and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not a primary tier but clearly it will build over time. Sony needs to add more classics but as early adopters ppl should realize the $1.80 (extra per month on yearly) tier will probably take time to build a classics/trials lineup. In some ways Sony has been for the players going back to PS4 launch and in others they haven‚Äôt. Helping push xb away from drm,great games, free vr titles, overall lack of mtx, covid initiative games, strong ps+ essential lineups after extra launched (see GwG), supporting VR, free dlc (Days Gone, Returnal, Tsushima, GT, Gravity Rush, Dreams, Destruction AS, Firewall, Farpoint, B&T, Concrete Genie, KZ), stellar next gen support (RTX, 3D audio, Dualsense), PS5 Digital 399 launch price, internal batteries, non proprietary ssd expansion. Yet $70 games, GT7 mtx, European ps5 price increase have been the opposite.

2917,CommandingTiger,"August 31, 2022 at 2:13 pm PDT","It seems like the Deluxe and Premium tiers seems a bit lacking in PSP, PS1 and PS2 games.You should maybe get more of these titles. Here‚Äôs my main question I have with Premium, why isn‚Äôt it a priority if it‚Äôs the highest tier? I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be plenty more games down the line, in a few years, but isn‚Äôt it in PlayStation best interest to want fans to upgrade to the highest tier? Wouldn‚Äôt you benefit from a higher cash flow. Now in my opinion, Classics should have been a ‚ÄúLite‚Äù tier as a basic tier because it absolutely makes zero sense to pay more to play older games that honestly can be emulated in some capacity, but people want to play it officially natively on a PS console, not streaming. I love the games getting into Essential and Extra tier, but the Ultimate tier should have been something more. I got a feeling like you are purposefully tricky down games in a monthly basis because of the limited amount of games that you‚Äôll eventually run out later down the down and people may not be as interested to play them if they can play them all today. However on the flip side, the lack of games significantly reduces the potential upgrade to the highest tier possible if there aren‚Äôt like 100s more games to start things off with.

2992,GermaximusS,"August 31, 2022 at 11:10 am PDT",The merge of PS+ and PS Now is a sloppy mess.

3004,grapetrap,"August 19, 2022 at 12:42 pm PDT","After 6 entries into the series as a button-mashing fighter-style game, it was nice that they changed up the combat system for Like a Dragon.  As the article explains, the combat style fits with the lore of the game, as Ichiban is a big fan of the Dragon Quest series.  It just makes sense that in his imagination, when he fights, it would be like this. We are always looking for the studios to change up the stale old way they present games but then when they do we complain they changed it up.  The combat may not be perfect or even as good as other similar systems in other games, But it fits this situation and added a fresh new game system to the Yakuza series. Of course, if the game had Kiryu as the main protagonist then the combat would be wrong‚Ä¶ Try out the Judgment series if you haven‚Äôt already. Those games are more like the old-school Yakuza games but with a new perspective on the districts.",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/08/19/the-evolution-of-the-yakuza-series/
