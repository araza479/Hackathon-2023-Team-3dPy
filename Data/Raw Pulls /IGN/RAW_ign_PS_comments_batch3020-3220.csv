HiddenDagr,"27 January, 2023",I'm glad they aren't milking the series. Better to end on a high note than to just keep making them until they start to fail. I feel like it isn't best for the developers either to get too comfy just doing the same series over and over.,naughty-dog-no-more-uncharted-but-tons-of-potential-with-series
Nick930930,"27 January, 2023","I think Nathan Drake's story is done. And I really don't care to see Sam, Nadine, or Chloe expanded on either. 
The only ""new"" story I'd maybe want would be a prequel game of Drake and Sully's earlier days. Otherwise - just gimme remakes/remasters of the first 3 games whenever enough time as passed. ...

LordKri,"27 January, 2023","As much as I hate the idea of not having anymore games with Nathan Drake, I get it and it's probably better off this way.

RealFrowns,"27 January, 2023","I'm probably done with Naughty Dog until they move on from TLOU. I enjoyed Uncharted and TLOU 1 was okay, but I have no interest in more TLOU.

That said, hopefully they move on to a new IP that is more interesting and fun.",naughty-dog-no-more-uncharted-but-tons-of-potential-with-series
Kraven-The-Hunter,"27 January, 2023","I only got into Uncharted recently (kinda skipped 2-3 gen's of consoles) and I must say I was missing out on something truly special. Even the first game, as rough as it is, was really enjoyable. There's just something about these characters and their journey that drew me instantly in.

Dinsfire117,"27 January, 2023","I’m glad Naughty Dog has moved on. I want new IP from them. As a community, let’s move past the mindset that studios must saturate the market with successive sequels. There’s beauty in finality, and Uncharted ended on a beautiful last note. Making new memories in a brand new Naughty Dog game doesn’...
