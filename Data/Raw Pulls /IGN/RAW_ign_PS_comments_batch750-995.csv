ILikeYourFace,"30 October, 2023","Okay some points I would like to mention in no particular order.
-I actually had some fun playing as MJ, but she wasn't just a little OP. She was taking killing blows and walking them off like it was nothig, and in some cases being more effective than the actual Spider-men. Playing as her is more fu...

JesterCanuck,"30 October, 2023","Then, also, the other thing was it was really important to me that Miles and Pete had the same number of suits.
This feels arbitrary and a mistake, because Miles really only has five canon suits and Peter has dozens.

GuybrushNoBeard,"30 October, 2023","The tough thing about bringing Carnage into this game is that the Spiderman games are traditionally pretty G rated.
So I wonder how they'll deal with that.

Mickey1211,"10 October, 2023","This company loves putting out hardware.
They put out more hardware than games these days.
Anyway,  I was going to wait for the Pro, but I'll probably just pick this up instead.
It is substantially smaller.  Thank God.  If a console ever needed a Slim version, it's the PS5.",see-how-the-ps5-slim-compares-side-by-side-with-the-launch-version-and-xbox
NDIrishfan71,"15 October, 2023","The PS5 without the drive does not look very bad, but with the disc drive it is aweful. I love mine, but I have hated the design ever since I got it.

Ada’Matsu,"10 October, 2023","I don’t know how I feel about it, 
It just looks like a smaller version of the regular PS5. I thought it would have some small aesthetic changes or something? Like the PS4 and PS4 Slim were visually different.
