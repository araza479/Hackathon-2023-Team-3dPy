Owlek,"3 July, 2023","God, where are the unbiased articles? the comics have been criticized by the fandom precisely for feeling like fanfic instead of a sequel, modifying and oversimplifying the characters losing all the serious tone of the original game, the Steph's book, like Clementine's comic from The Walking Dead a...

Unless the sliver of westerners who read manga were familiar with the series it’s been 4 years since season one came out and season two is only just about to start.
