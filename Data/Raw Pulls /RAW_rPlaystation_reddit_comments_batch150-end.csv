https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1329ltb/gaming_hurts_so_much/,Dickastigmatism,8 mo. ago,"/u/gsnow on waves of grief, a reddit classic that's meaningful to meAlright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks."

Permanently banned this afternoon as was my husband's account. We never got an email and our appeal will not be accepted. We have done nothing wrong and have thousands invested in games and equipment. I finally made it to a chat and once I gave the login they disconnected me and said they couldn't help.

Account suspension should only result in not being able to play or shop.  Instead you‚Äôre locked out of the whole system, unable to change personal, AuthN, or financial info, no way to stop any subscriptions due to no fault of your own.  You can try to contact support, but for all intents and purposes it doesn‚Äôt exist.  Even if you can get ahold of somebody after hours of trying, they just tell you to go to a website that YOU just explained isn‚Äôt working to them and hang up on you!"

I tried logging into the website the other day but it kept giving me an error, but I didn't think much of it and there was nothing weird going on when I was playing games the last few days, but I'm hesitant to sign in now.  They haven't even given out a ""we are aware of a situation"" comment which is disheartening.  I don't play online, haven't had Plus in forever, and still buy physical, but there's also a ton of digital games I'd hate to lose and I would never go back and re-earn the 5000+ trophies.  Hope everything gets resolved for everyone quickly."

We have a company that can, and will permanently ban their customers without giving any reason. Potentially thousands of dollars of product stolen back from the consumer in an instant. And, in general, the consumer has little or no recourse. When the product is digital, it‚Äôs no longer regarded as property. It‚Äôs this ephemeral thing and the rights we have to it are wishy-washy at best given the above.In my view, no company, no entity that sells content of any kind, should ever have this amount of power and agency over the product once it has been sold. Digital content must be regarded as property or else the whole system breaks down. And don‚Äôt get bogged down in the ‚Äúwell, you signed the EULA‚Äù trash argument. Yes, it is written that way. No, it shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to be. And buyer beware is no longer the standard for operating a business in developed societies."

So, there‚Äôs a list of problematic aspects to these companies‚Äô practices which are broad and deep and they really need to be addressed. They still have all of your personal information, some of it public-facing. They still have your credit cards, ostensibly under lock and key. And should you want to delete all of that (to the degree you can realistically do that), you can‚Äôt even log in to try. It goes on‚Ä¶But you know the thing that really boggles the mind? However upset we get over this one instance, if Sony fixes it tomorrow and un-bans the fake bans, this issue will disappear for them and they‚Äôll likely not hear anything else about it.And I can‚Äôt stress this enough, this really isn‚Äôt about a single goof-up or DDOS attack or whatever is going on. It‚Äôs a systemic problem and what we‚Äôre experiencing is a part of the design."

To be honest it seems a lot of people are having this issue today for some reason, so I believe there might possibly be an error going on at PlayStation at the moment, that's what I'm assuming.  I recommend waiting to see if the issue fixes on it's own, or you can try chatting with an agent from PlayStation using this link:https://www.playstation.com/support/contact-us/direct/?category=PS+Direct(Currently returns ERROR 404)You can also use this link to check your suspension status form to see more information about it:https://www.playstation.com/support/contact-us/?category=Acc&subCategory=suspI hope my answer was helpful, please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with?Posted by Mary J83 answers | 92% rating19:58"""

I got the same message today. I created an account for my partner in the past to link her local account. It has 0 purchases and hasn't been used except as a second player but I see the same message.

Wasted a whole day trying to remedy this crap. Sony better own up to this. It's the very LEAST they can do at this point. Otherwise they've lost a ton of trust. Australia btw

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/18at3ia/hi_there_i_have_a_problem_what_should_i_do_now_i/,Oculosis,24 days ago,Only way for Sony to restore trust in their digital games is by moving to a GoG type system. Where games are something you can backup. Reinstall and play to completion while offline. Give to anyone I wish on a whim so they can install it (too much customer power? &$#@ you Sony you burned this bridge first). I never want Denuvo or some rubbish which makes my experience worse than pirates either.I want DRM-free digital games on consoles. Like iTunes songs are DRM-free. Or some ebooks. DRM digital media is worth nothing to me anymore. Physical is a little different since we've always found ways of ripping them.

It looks so cool, but I was 13ish, and I didn't cut out the buttons properly, so some parts around the start  and face buttons were just basically ruined and that only reason it still stayed on was because it was sticky enough lol. Eventually, I had to take it off because the edges were coming off and had gathered a lot of dirt. But I had to keep the skin on back on because it had taken off the paint and detail when I tried to remove it. I had that white one that came with the starwars game and had Darth Vader on the battery cover. I still have it somewhere, but it doesn't work anymore after I let my brother use it, and he didn't care enough to put it back in the cover and just left it in some random drawer with a bunch of crap that eventually broke it. I only keep it as a reminder. Also, I can't be that mad at him about since he was the one who bought it for me as a Christmas present"

I never actually finished itBurnout Legends seemed like more of a collection on minigames than an actual game like Paradise would be on PS3/4SvR swapped D pad controls with the stick and removed commentary and some other featuresHonourable mention to LocoRoco, the demo I downloaded and mastered and really enjoyed, and Ridge Racer 2, another demo I used to challenge myself to how much I could win by. I love it so much that I started playing when it released on PlayStation+ Premium.MediEvil seemed like the most full game, no borked controls, a great soundtrack, a brilliant storyline, plenty of new additions and improvements on the PS1 game and the writing and voice acting, especially having Tom Baker as Death/Narrator means it's still my favourite PSP game and one of my favourite PS exclusives to this day."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/161ekjb/whats_the_first_game_that_comes_to_mind/,Flamesclaws,4 mo. ago,I've heard mixed things about Medievil on the PSP but I'm still glad I bought a copy. I'll have to play it one day.
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/161ekjb/whats_the_first_game_that_comes_to_mind/,TristianHill,4 mo. ago,"I actually bought it again as a digital download for my PS Vita because my PSP has long since passed away. When I first played it, I needed cheats but it ended up being one of the first games I beat legit on any console. Can't recommend it highly enough, and it's a real improvement on the already good PS1 version. Because the PS4 remaster was kept so close to the PS1 original, there are still some things I prefer about the PSP version, especially Al Zalaam and the narrator as characters, even if MediEvil for PS4 is the best game of the three overall"

If that's something you okay with I think you took the wrong lessons from the series.Edit 3: To respond to what the person who blocked me for pointing out the truth said it's way more than her Twitter.

But it‚Äôs still fair enough for people to point out that the main benefactor of this game does donate IP proceeds to anti-trans groups, which are very often also anti-LGBQ+ as well.Why block them for pointing out the way the world is? They are correct. If you buy this game, you are monetarily supporting one of the biggest voices of pro-violence towards trans people. I for one can live with that because she‚Äôs already a billionaire and this is basically residuals for her, she‚Äôs not really directly involved. But I don‚Äôt see why you think they‚Äôre weird for saying it. It‚Äôs a legitimate fact. Just like if you buy an Xbox you‚Äôre supporting bill gates.

It's great to be a 3rd party observer in the book or movie medium, but it's a very shitty poorly designed sport when you get down to brass tacks."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10mgoii/who_is_hyped_for_this_game/,ChrisBtheRedditor,11 mo. ago,"What makes it poorly designed?At its core, it's just like any other team sport imo. Two teams, goals on the opposite end of the field, one ball, put ball in goal. The only difference is that players could fly and that's what makes the sport intriguing to me.As for player friendliness, I'm sure a multi-billion company with thousands of devs can come up with a way to make it fun to play in a video game setting. I'm guessing a lot of work is required to get this done and they thought it's not worth doing for what is essentially a side activity. But still, I think quidditch is such a big part of the Harry Potter universe that they should have made it playable, even with just simple mechanics."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10mgoii/who_is_hyped_for_this_game/,Meewwt,11 mo. ago,If the game was exactly as you described it would be perfectly fine. However you left out the most important-and incidentally the most broken-part which is the snitch/seeker.What you have there is a position that is infinitely more important than the others (the game straight up cannot end until it's caught) catching it is worth 15 times what a regular goal is worth. And lastly (I'm open to correction if I'm wrong about this part) the other players are NOT allowed to catch the snitch at all. So basically you have a team game where everything hinges on a single player (what's that saying about no I in team?). The rest of your team can be incredible getting goals left and right but if the seeker is shit then it's tough breaks.Basically to me it seems like two perfectly fine sports mashed together to make a hideous amalgamation. The seeker/snitch could be a perfectly fine 1v1 sport in it's own right and all the other positions make for a perfectly fine team game. Mashed together they don't work on any real level beyond being a fantastical thought experiment.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10mgoii/who_is_hyped_for_this_game/,Kordidk,11 mo. ago,Or they take longer to actually develop a good game? As it is it's disappointing that they can't make 2 narratives for one of the largest media franchises in the world. They don't have to make it some crazy interwoven thing where it takes minute details into account when determining what storyline to play.

These systems don't actually play the game off the disk, they are only used as an install media/license check. This is where games are starting to hit the current Ultra HD Bluray limit of 100GB. Unless they start including two disks, its cheaper to have people download the extra data.Nintendo Switch even has some physical releases just be a display box with a code to download the game.

So extrapolate from there and assume it‚Äôs cheap.You can fit approximately 90,000 cases in a standard shipping container. On average a shipping container costs $8,500 from China to the US. That‚Äôs about nine cents per unit.There‚Äôs also costs to get it to retailers and the retailer markup, but these aren‚Äôt going to be huge costs per unit either.Then we have to consider that digital releases aren‚Äôt free either.

I can't see how the digital versions could be as costly as physical copies for companies. Cos the servers will mantain just one copy for each game (maybe some more for safety reasons), and people will download that same copy, just getting a different license. It doesn't seem for me that it is a great amounf of data that could be super costly. For physical it needs manufacturing, shipping from factory to retailer, retailer's margin/profit, and sometimes shipping from retailer to consumer, and that is for every one of those copies. Well, at least that's how i think it works."

When a company makes physical editions, they spend a set amount in making the physical editions and that's it, normally around $5 per copy, but for a digital copy they need to pay Sony or valve or Microsoft to keep that server with that game up and running indefinitely, which costs the publisher about 30% of the store price. And those servers will need to be up for an unknown amount of time, digital stores have been around for less than 20 years right now, but games bought 10 years ago might still have demand to be downloaded in another 20 years or more!$5 for the physical manufacturing is less than 30% of a full price game, and about the same as 30% of a digital game on sale."

Inflation isn't a good argument; 60 dollars today makes more now than 60 back then due to market expansion. Publishers are making more profit than ever in the history of the business, and that's before post sale transactions AND with rising development costs considered. Sometimes greed is greed.It's also a bit of a lie that games back then were $60-70 and doesn't quite tell the full story. Games were anywhere from 20 to 80 dollars, but often went on sale, and there wasn't much of a standardized price until the PS2/GameCube era where prices were definitively set at 49.99.It was so set in stone that it was controversial when prices rose to 59.99.Before that it was much more wild west when it came to pricing, with the N64 being the strangest outlier due to some carts having expensive chips in them. That console had really wild pricing.But you can't really point at the 90s and say ""Games were the same price,"" because many were cheaper on launch. Many were more expensive. It was a case by case basis.A lot of people remember 49.99 being the standard because itwas, but much later on during the PS2 era, when a lot of people were entering high school and making their own purchases. Even then it was a common price even before that so it's unsurprising people forgot that a lot of the AAA's from the day charged a premium.Plus they probably purchased them on sale even if they do remember. Videogames were treated the same as toys and got more frequent discounts, especially during holidays. The sales we see now are much more controlled and take a longer time from release.Either way inflation doesn't really count nowadays in this industry and shouldn't be defended - The sales quantities they make now are unprecedented, and with the crazy profit margins, post sale transactions, really the market should be coming down in price.Also yes, this does consider the rising cost of game development. They're still making more. Even if the game doesn't drag you through the MTX/season pass grinder.Not that gamesneedto be more expensive to create now. They're making that poor decision themselves. Who is even asking for all these technological bells and whistles? It doesn't even make for good and better games - Gameplay does. Which has honestly been forgotten in the AAA market. So many AAA's just feel like ass in favor of visual appeal. Experiences instead ofgames.I suppose there's a reason that AA and indies are thriving. Which is one of the plus sides to where the market has headed. We don't even have to worry about the mainstream if we don't want to.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_fXwC93KZk"

If I had Castlevania and someone else had Megaman we'd each get to play both."

In games like Mario, bugs were fixed when shipping to US market, more bugs were fixed when shipping to European market a little bit later. They would also just ship newer versions to stores and if you were unlucky and bought a game early, you could have bought the buggy version and get stuck with game breaking bugs.It's often why there are very specific versions of games from EU, NA or JP that are important for specific speedrun categories.Games werent bug-free, far from it. Plenty of games could have used day 1 patches.In the 90s and early 2000s, you would have to use altavista to find patches for game breaking bugs (I'm looking at you Red Alert 2!) and download them painstackinly through dialup, taking years, only to reach 99% and then some jerk phones to your house."

That is effectively true for Xbox games however if you buy a Ps4/5 game the overwhelming majority of the time that game can be beaten from start menu to credits just using the disc with no online file downloading required. Obviously it's becoming more and more of an issue thar some games require persistent online connections to function and many games receive day 1 updates that provide extra features or simply allow the game to run better but especially on ps4 and 5 most games do have the full game on disc even if that isn't the best version. Switch has a different issue where there carts have a much lower storage size and so some third party games require downloads however the packaging does indicate this and Nintendo themselves have never released a game that requires a download to function as far as I know.Source: personal experience and the @DoesitPlay1 twitter account.

Just look at the response to Sutherland in V. Also a lot of the OG cast are way older, might not recapture the magic (look at twin snakes re-recording for example, it‚Äôs not as good as MGS1), they might sound way older and it might not fit. Do they even want to be apart of a re-recording, are they even available? I know some of the Japanese cast have unfortunately died now too. So do they then recast one language but not another?

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/137y067/playstation_the_last_10_years/,KolbStomp,8 mo. ago,Bluepoint Bloodborne please.
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/137y067/playstation_the_last_10_years/,HerakIinos,8 mo. ago,It seems the code of Bloodborne is a nightmare to work with. Thats probably why we havent gotten a 60fps update to the PS5 and a PC release. We would need either a remake or a remaster for a PC version to happen.
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/137y067/playstation_the_last_10_years/,sahneeis,8 mo. ago,only a speculation but my guess is that sony doesnt want to interfere with elden ring out of respect for fromsoftware.  bluepoint doing a remake of bloodborne is a nobrainer
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/137y067/playstation_the_last_10_years/,HerakIinos,8 mo. ago,"I dont think thats the case. Elden ring is already one year old. I know the DLCs are yet to come but if they were working on a bloodborne remake, it wouldnt interfere with Elden Ring at this point. Hell, even Fromsoft is about to release a new game.We probably will get it later."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/137y067/playstation_the_last_10_years/,ThatDudeFromFinland,8 mo. ago,"If I remember correctly, there were some really tangled up licensing and ownership things behind Bloodborne... It ain't coming to PC, probably never. Just get a PS."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/137y067/playstation_the_last_10_years/,Au2Burn,8 mo. ago,"This is true, not sure why the downvotes. Because it's a Sony exclusive despite fromsoftware having a publishing deal with Bandai it really complicates the rights for a remaster or remake. Furthermore, Sony Japan, who holds the licensing for Bloodborne, no longer exists. So who would publish a Bloodborne Remake? Lawyers & a judge most likely would decide.Aside from these rights issues, the code is utterly complex. Jeff Grubb said the code is spaghetti & the only ones who could work on it would be the original team. In other words, Bluepoint is not getting their hands on it like Demon Souls Remake. Furthermore, FromSoft has AC VI on the horizon, as well as ER DLC in process. You think they'll put resources aside for a maybe? They've got definite millions in sales for a dlc that'll prob be $20, but could even be $30 (admit it, you'd pay $30!) They ain't taking away from their success with Elden Ring to work on Bloodborne anything any time soon."

I don't see any point for Sony to bring it out to other formats. With it's cult status, it's a system seller just like Demon's Souls."

So Hogwarts Legacy for example is one of those with a Pegi rating and Italian print on the back. But you can still choose any language you want in-game.But by doing that they have lower buying costs and can undercut big retailers. So no matter the version, the games are 25% off there when they are new. Sometimes you then get a German version, like it happen with Dead Space and Jedi, and you essentially got the same thing as on Amazon but just way cheaper, or you get a box with different language print but the game acts like it's a German version and defaults to German anyway.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/130mjvx/my_girlfriend_moved_to_another_city_so_i_decided/,leospeedleo,8 mo. ago,"No, it's regular pricing. Physical games here in Europe are often way cheaper, especially if the games have been out for a bit. But if you know some stores you can save money even on Day 1.New PS5 games are 80‚Ç¨ here in Europe. That's what you have to pay if you buy the German versions of games on Amazon or big retailers that are the equivalent to your Best Buy.But there's also small shops like mine around. My local shop is a small thing in one city that happens to have a website. What's nice about them: They aren't limited to German versions of games. They sell both German versions (big rating logos) with our ratings and German print on the back, but also international versions (small rating logos) with Pegi rating and print on the back in other languages. All of those games still work in German but they cost less.So my shop essential sells all 80‚Ç¨ games for 60‚Ç¨ on release day. Hogwarts was 55‚Ç¨ instead of 75‚Ç¨ and Jedi 60‚Ç¨ instead of 80‚Ç¨. As I don't care that the back of Hogwarts is in Italian, I can just save money there. Dead Island 2 is Pegi because the German version is cut slightly and my shop also offers the uncut versions for the same price (50‚Ç¨ instead of 70‚Ç¨), so I had to go with that.So with every game pretty much being 25% off MSRP at my shop, I essentially got one of those 4 games for free compared to buying them either new digitally or new physically at a big retailer in their German version :)"

I‚Äôve platinumed/100%ed Sekiro twice and Elden Ring once, whereas for DS3, I only have a few inconsequential achievements left before I 100% that as well. The problem with comparing difficulty of their games to one another is that system mechanics may be more intuitive than others to the player. Some may find that Sekiro‚Äôs deflect/parry is easy (OP has played GoT which has similar mechanics), where as others (like myself) may find the gun parrying of Bloodborne to be extremely unintuitive or difficult. I‚Äôve seen many people rank Bloodborne as one of the easiest or one of the hardest.Comparing the different Dark Souls games to one another makes sense because they all have similar enough system mechanics with the main difference being boss/world design. Sekiro and Bloodborne both emphasize aggressiveness though, and play fairly differently compared to Dark Souls.I do understand that generally speaking, a lot of fans consider Sekiro to be the hardest, but I believe that may be due to how different that game is from the Dark Souls series. I was also hesitant on playing Sekiro because I don‚Äôt like difficult games very often but was pleasantly surprised by what I ended up experiencing. My assumption was that if OP enjoyed GoT enough to platinum it, they might enjoy Sekiro as well simply due to the whole strike/parry combat system."

The issue here is that it‚Äôs a disastrous broken trophy list which seems really unpleasant to grind for.I will say that if you are looking forward to this game and not just buying it for the platinum then don‚Äôt use this write up by Pyx to make a decision solely on the game.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1175f17/legendary_trophy_guides_writer_isnt_a_fan/,Chriswebb3608,10 mo. ago,"Bruh the guy makes guides for people hunting for trophies, and he covers way more than just games that are ""easy and fast"", he just approaches the games from the easiest and fastest ways to get the trophies. Kind of the whole point of what he does. No one's telling you that you can't like the game. It's clearly a discussion involving trophy hunters in regard to this game and a respected guide maker's opinion. If you're not into it, just take a hike instead of replying to like every other comment. You're taking it way too personally."

You also had built in wifi and HDMI. $599 for just a game console is ridiculous, but once you factor in the multimedia aspect it becomes more justified. I got the PS5 within the first year partly because it has a 4K blu ray drive and supports all my TV services. Also has a remote, which my Xbox One S didn‚Äôt."

Not to mention, it is an investment for the future when these start to become harder to come by.But I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from.

So when you are moving fast say while swinging, driving or riding, pieces of the environment sometimes can‚Äôt load in fast enough so you see them ‚Äúpop in‚Äù while moving at a fast speed.

I think they made reference to some elements being cut post day 1 patch we had, this caused more visual and game breaking bugs etcFor the reflections; buildings are fine, some cars are fine, landmarks are fine, skylines and so on. Trees are one of the elements which have been sacrificed it seems.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/17ewrxx/pretty_amazing_the_ps5_is_capable_of_reflections/,robbertzzz1,2 mo. ago,"It's a technique to get accurate lighting in games and other 3D media. It has been the standard in 3D animation for decades, but only recently have GPUs been good enough to achieve it in real time.Ray tracing is a technique that shoots out rays from the camera, like a mirrored version of light coming into the camera, and those rays collect material data of objects they hit. Each ray can bounce off of objects a few times to allow for reflections like in these screenshots; they first collect material data of the glossy surface, bounce off it like a mirror, then collect material data of the next surface they hit. This data is then passed back to the camera to make up the colour of the pixel it belongs to.This is all a bit simplified, what you should know is that it's a technique that tries to simulate actual light rays hitting the camera.Previously, the only lighting objects could receive in games was either directly from a light or from some form of baked reflection - you wouldn't see any moving objects in those reflections and the positions of reflections would often be wrong. An additional technique called ""screen space reflections"" would often be applied to make the computer create some cheap reflections based on what's on screen. This technique can only create reflections in a 2D space and you'd often see weird glitches from it like reflections being on the wrong side and no reflections being visible near the edge of the screen.Source: I develop games for a living."

I believe that once you've got the ps5 version downloaded you should be able to just launch that. I know in the past you'd always have to have the disc even if you were playing the updated PS5 version but I think they've updated the system since then and you don't need it anymore as long as you're trying to start the PS5 version. Maybe I'm getting it wrong though.

You can also try those rubber grips for your controller. If anything, if your PS5 was bought within that year you can probably get Sony to give you a new one. Remember that it will probably take a week or more, I got mines about two months later. Depending on how chewed it is you can get a new shell for it for pretty cheap. Hope it helps."

And finally, if the worry is that low sales would lead to the company being shut down, that is not an argument for buying the game, but for the leadership at Avalance to create a more sustainable company. It also is an argument for supporting worker unionization so that developers are able to fight for a more sustainable financial structure at their company that doesn‚Äôt rely on record-breaking sales of a single game for them to feel secure in their job. To frame not buying Hogwarts Legacy as hurting the developers places the onus on consumers to help the devs, when that is the responsibility of their employers, and it ends up leading to seeing trans people calling for not giving attention to the game as villains trying to hurt developers when we are not.""They dedicated an entire paragraph to explain a misunderstanding of how developers get paid...but they ultimately showcased the fact that they completely misunderstand how businesses work.Yes, all of the devs got paid for the work they did...but if the game doesn't sell, then it means the company as a whole may not be able to produce further products to sell. Avalanche Studios was purchased by WB Games back in 2017, and this is the only game they've made and released since then. So, their future employment and existence as a companydoeshinge upon this one product, to one extent or another. WB Games is a for-profit company and if the studios under their umbrella don't do well, companies get shuttered and people lose jobs.While none of us are required to buy any game, glossing over the negative impact of a boycott doesn't do anyone any good; they're just ignoring all of the folks who stand to get hurt in their quest to take down Rowling. Trans people may not be calling for the devs to get hurt, but they could definitely wind up as collateral damage.I'm not saying people shouldn't boycott or ignore their game for their own personal reasons; it's their prerogative, and I'm a firm believer in people voting with their wallets. With that being said, it's also nice if they're not being intentionally ignorant during the process."

Okay cool. So you put some thoughts into who/what gets your money. Good on you. You are cool with the practices of the companies that make your phone? Your clothes? Good chance you're probably something of a hypocrite. Somebody that you very much disagree with the practices or beliefs of is probably getting your money. If it is at a small enough level that what you and some like minded people will cause the success or failure of the person or idea that you stand against I totally see the point. If it is a situation where they're already too financially secure or there is otherwise no difference made whether or not you contribute, and is something you otherwise would enjoy, why not enjoy it?I don't mean all of the 'you' directed to you specifically but in general,  and I realize how cynical/ defeatist all of this sounds, but I just feel that if you were to put the same standard to everything you buy, you would buy very little, and be a very miserable people. If it's something that makes you happy, go for it. Bringing it back to J.K., okay, you're a Potter fan but disagree with her? Does you not partaking of this fandom prevent her from being filthy rich? Hell, if every single one of us were to never give her or WB or Universal or anything else she's affiliated with that she gets some cut from another cent, does that somehow take away her existing fortune of (let me go look this up ) ¬£820,000,000? She's rich regardless, not changing; I'm going to go enjoy by what all standards sounds like a great game. No disrespect, and apologies for the long-windedness."

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10v498b/looking_great_who_ready_for_it/,missingmytowel,11 mo. ago,People don't realize that when you give a game these ratings you are directly comparing it to other games that have received the same ratings. Hogwarts Legacy is good. But to think it stacks against many of the other 9 or 10 out of 10 rated games we have seen in the past decade is laughable.Like how can any serious critic give RDR2 a 10 out of 10 and then a few years later give this game the same exact rating?
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/10v498b/looking_great_who_ready_for_it/,Silist,11 mo. ago,That‚Äôs not how I view ratings at all. I think different games in different genres have a completely different feel. You don‚Äôt compare adventure games to shooter games. It‚Äôs about what the individual game itself brought to the table and the enjoyment you had playing it.

I happened to play Hot Wheels since release and that game is extremely polished. I went into it with low expectations and was surprised to see how well of a Kart Racer it is. I will admit, if you don‚Äôt have any of the dlc, replay value drops. Not much to do when you finish the story and have all the cars unlocked. Unless online is all you care for anyways. But still, I thought It was a fantastic game that floated under everyone‚Äôs radar. The trailer for the 2nd one looks even better."

In fact it doesn‚Äôt change enemy health at all. Enemies die just as fast on hard as they do on easy. Difficulty only effects incoming damage, parry timing, and enemy aggressiveness."

For me it's a great background game while I listen to a podcast or watch something on my phone. Lots of fun unlocked everything and the couple of DLC tracks like the DC and Looney Tunes stuff was pretty fun.I'd say either Watchdogs or Hot Wheels but if you enjoyed the previous Jedi game, you'd probably like the second.Though I'd also throw out some other recommendations; God Of War (and Ragnarok), Returnal, Spider-man, Arkham Trilogy, Ghost of Tsushima, Sniper Elite 5"

I actually really enjoyed the story, it's deeper than most people paint it out to be. Also, the features are simple, fun, and classic to the watch dogs franchise. I also LOVED permadeath in that game, it made every combat moment feel important, especially if I used a member on my team I really liked and built up. Being able to recruit anyone in the streets is also really cool, while having to do a task for them to build up your trust. I recommend giving it a try if you like simple gun mechanics, puzzles here and there, and a decent story! Looks great with 60fps as well."

This game is the reason why Michael Schumacher started racing, when he was a young boy he played with his limited edition Batman Begins Hot Wheels car all day long, he always dreamed about being a hero that goes fast and look at him now. His dreams achieved because Hot Wheels was always there for him, and never gave up on him and the same it didn't give up on him, it won't give up on you.

Not to mention the actual story telling/cutscenes in days gone was leagues better with GoT having some of the worst cutscenes I have ever seen for a modern AAA exclusive.No joke it was at the level of a ps2 game. I‚Äôm not talking about the characters, I can see how people didn‚Äôt like deacon but the actual camera angles, staging and character animation etc‚Ä¶.Just weird to me.

We've seen apocalypse, we've seen ruins, we've seen dirty brown and shacks and rotting Suburbs.  Not to say those things are BAD or that Days didn't have some standout lush environments, but there wasn't a whole lot of new there. Ghost was a feast, visually.  From the particle effects of snow and cherry blossoms, to the light, to the beauty of the scenery, it was one of those games that you could have stand-out moments just wandering across the map.  Comparitively, Ghost felt very modern, aesthetically, and Days often felt like a PS3 era ""Gritty-Dirty-Brown"" game, stylistically."

Specifically the combat was exceptional and the art design is great. Just don‚Äôt look close because the texture work is well below most games of that caliber/production.I wanted to love the game, I heard all of the great things that critics/fans mentioned and even tried it again with the PS5 upgrade.

It made for some really cinematic and visually striking experiences.As for the cutscenes, I don't particularly recall them being terrible, but I don't have high standards when it comes to those things, so you're probably right about a lot of it.I think overall I found the game was good enough at the things that mattered most, that I could excuse the blemishes."

I can still just recognize that if you can walk (not crouched) along side a human enemy NPC,just one-degreepast their ear, they‚Äôll never see you and you can effectually sneak up on people while basically running directly at them‚Ä¶that just not very good mechanics for a game that tries to get you to rely on stealth. You really don‚Äôt need to be very sneaky. And then once you perk for quiet running, you don‚Äôt need to sneak at all, just stay at a slight angle from being directly head on and the enemy will never see you.The snipers are the only NPC you even need to remotely hide from during the entire game.The game was great. Super fun. Enjoyed it all the way through. But it has a lot of sloppy faults, namely, the blind enemies. But the sound mixing is also terrible. The game also makes a big deal out of weather effecting the zombie behavior, and it doesn‚Äôt, other than make them even more blind and even easier to simply walk up to and press triangle for an instant kill lolI loved the overall story and plot and most of the characters, but the development of them was also really bad. Like why was Rikki so insanely jealous of Deeks wife even tho they made her a lesbianandin a relationship, and why did they make  Addison just completely cool with that fact, ‚Äúyou know where to find me‚Äù and then just walks off while her apocalypse wife sits there pissed at Deek for having a wife.

[...] SIKE! She's not dead! We got you soooo good! I bet you didn't see that one coming!Most plot twists on this game are predictable. Unless the player wasn't paying attention, there's no way Sarah's survival surprised anyone. And the game expected it to be a big moment, when they kept spoiling it over and over again.The enemy variety is pretty much the same as every other zombie game. The only exception I can mention are the crows, but they're restricted to specific areas, and once you destroy the nests there's nothing left of them.The world in this game is empty, there's nothing to do or find outside the collectibles and the handfull of not really imaginative side mission. I like picking flowers and hunting animals, but that doesn't cut it on a 100 hours campaing. And you can deflect all you want mentioning how good the world looks, but I'm not here to appreciate the scenarie.The game is unnecessarily long. The story drags on for way too long  on a world not interesting enough to justify it's length. In fact, at a certain point the only ""new"" thing are the hordes' sizes.Crafting sucks and it's unnecessary. There are materials EVERYWHERE. Once you find a few good spots to farm crafting becomes a footnote. Isn't it supposed to be a post-apocalyptic game? Some scarcity would give that feeling.Speaking of hordes, they're one of the few good things on this game, but not a new or creative thing, just one that's exceedingly well executed. I genuinely believe this is what carried the whole game. There's no way it would have achieved the reception it got without them. And they're easy to cheese, anyway."

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/15nx0hk/do_you_think_days_gone_deserves_a_sequel/,Penguinbar,5 mo. ago,"Yeah, I think it does. I played it as part of the playstation collection. I thought the game was fun. Although I did find the beginning section to be a slow burn. I don't think the game really picked up for me until I was 6 hours or more into it.Like the hordes were fun, and I thought the story got much more interesting towards the middle and end. Then we got a cliffhanger. I was pretty interested in finding out what's next."

The fans, Cancel culture, Sony, The media, etc etc etc. He doesn‚Äôt seem to realize that maybe the game did bad because it simply just wasn‚Äôt good. It launched in a piss-poor state, and shouldn‚Äôt have been sold for more than $15.The writing is genuinely so awful that I‚Äôve never been able to make it longer than 5-6 hours into the game without stopping due to cringe. I read the storyline on Wikipedia, and honestly that was better writing than what we got out of the stiff cliche dialogue in game. From what I‚Äôve heard there have been lots of other gamers who shared the same issue. I know multiple people on my friends list who also gave up on it because of poor pacing and bad dialogue.The developer has a bad case of David Ayer syndrome. They poured their heart into something that wasn‚Äôt meant to be, and they don‚Äôt know how to move on all these years later from their bad excuse for a game."

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/11g6zmo/finally_got_my_set_up_done/,Interesting-Fact-803,10 mo. ago,The angle was from pushing it back for VR. When I play normal games I pull it all the way forward bring it 4ft closer and level it out.
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/11g6zmo/finally_got_my_set_up_done/,socokid,10 mo. ago,"So you stand when you are playing?Otherwise, there is no way that TV is at eye level when sitting on a normal couch. You would definitely still be looking up at that. Pulling it closer would literally make the angle evenworsefor you neck... unless it's actually also pulled down.Using something like this."
https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/11g6zmo/finally_got_my_set_up_done/,Fury_Blackwolf,10 mo. ago,Then there's only one explanation. Your couch is too high as well.

https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/11y1c7e/these_games_8_years_apart/,Rfl0,9 mo. ago,"Yeah, but, the setting, characters and art direction of the game invites comparison.  I'm also pretty sure the general public has no distinction between the developers, they just see ""Batman game"" or ""Gotham game"" and make the connection."
