Bad reviews don’t represent the game, if you’re a fan of metroidvania games, you’l definitely love it.Pros, it’s a very long game, doesn’t feel tedious because you have dozens of equipments and weapons and different combat styles for different weapons. Tons of enemies and each with different drop items, lots of bosses. Cons, the game is that huge that you get stuck pretty often and don’t know where to go. Some abilities of weapons aren’t explained and some definitions that aren’t clear, as well as some quests, the endings could have been more elaborated, it’s so much gameplay for the endings being so… is that all?

While not perfect, with beautiful art and music and a combat system that will feel both fresh and familiar, it is a strong contender for one of the best JRPGs of 2023 so far. The plot isn't anything to write home about and it's a tad on the easy side, but it remains engaging, especially for Mana series enthusiasts.

122,final fantasy vi pixel remaster,PC,RPG Fan,Critic,"Final Fantasy VI is easily the “crown jewel” of the pixel remaster releases given how much effort Square Enix put into it comparatively, and is certainly now the definitive version of the game to play. I honestly wish it hadn’t taken me as long as I had to play FFVI because I think it stands as one of my all-time favorite Final Fantasy games!

124,final fantasy vi pixel remaster,PC,JimmieRamone,User,"As a fan of this game ever since it first released in North America as Final Fantasy III, I now regard this as the definitive version of the game, with a couple of caveats.

First, it doesn't have the new Espers introduced in the Game Boy Advanced version, or the Dragon's Den bonus dungeon. I personally never felt those additions to be essential to the experience, but players of the GBA version may miss them.

Second, prepare yourself for the Opera House scene. The rearranged orchestra is great, and visually it's never looked better, but.. well, I'm hesitant to provide more details than that, as it felt like it was meant to be a surprise. You will have to take my word for it and judge for yourself when you hear it.

Finally, I highly recommend taking the time to download one of the many mods available to fix the font. There is one available for the SNES version's font that is superb. I only ran into one potential issue, where at a certain part of the game one of the longer dialogue prompt choices was cut off because the default font is quite a bit smaller than the one provided by the mod.

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with how this version of my favorite Final Fantasy ended up. The new orchestral arrangements of the songs are excellent, the backgrounds during battles have never looked better, and--with sincere apologies to Ted Woolsey's fans--the localization this time around is absolutely spot on. Must play.","Jul 2, 2023",7.9

None of these games are terribly long if you know what you’re doing, nor are they tremendously difficult. The stories are not super compelling on their own. They are little games in a way, and they are definitely aged. But if you loved these games before, these remasters are perfect for what they’re trying to do. They’re charming. They feel like a sudden rush of nostalgia not because they’re exactly the games you remember, but the rare form of remaster that does add some stuff on top while still preserving all of the spirit and intent perfectly.

143,final fantasy iii pixel remaster,PC,davygravy93,User,"A very good remaster of Final Fantasy 3, yes it does have some minor flaws but I would still argue that this is the definitive version since it adds some much needed quality of life changes that make the experience much more enjoyable that it was before.

There are a few changes to gameplay the most obvious being the auto battle feature which makes the encounter rate much less of a pain, there's now a run function when not in the overworld, omni directional movement, phoenix downs are much more common, secret passages now have subtle visual clues, and the dungeons now have an optional map you can use.

The visuals are very well done, I know many enjoyed the DS version but I think this pixel remaster is a much more elegant solution than the ds versions big ugly polygons. The sprites, levels, and attack effects have all been remade from the ground up but surprisingly it all meshes together evenly, nothing feels out of place..............well except for one incredibly obvious flaw. The text format. As many others have said the text that is used for dialogue looks horrible compared to everything else and what's worse is that they already use a better text format for damage calculation so there's literally no reason for it to look this bad.

I think it goes without saying that the re orchestrated music sounds fantastic and was my primary reason for buying this game. Nobuo Uematsu oversaw the music and it shows, every track has the level of quality you would expect from his work and in my opinion elevates the atmosphere of FF3 much higher than it was. This is also highly subjective but I think eternal wind is the standout track and possibly the best overworld theme in the entire series.

The story and characters wont blow you away, its a very basic light vs dark story with all the fantasy tropes you would expect **** from the famicom era. That being said the plot gets the job done, it never draws anything out more than it needs to so the pacing is relatively quick in that regard but this has the drawback of never allowing you to get attached to the characters you meet since they pop in and out of the adventure so quickly.

Pros:
+remastered music sounds amazing
+pixelated visuals pays homage to original style but isnt afraid to improve things like the water effects
+auto battle and other QOL changes make playing the game a breeze
Cons:
-terrible looking font looks terrible
-game is incredibly easy with exception of a few bosses","Jul 30, 2021",10

211,8doors arums afterlife adventure,PC,ffmyler,User,"I think that people don't do this game justice.

In the sea of Metroidvania games as of lately, this one really stands out for me!

- It has beautiful art style, hand drawn graphics.
- Nice level of difficulty throughout the game.
- Some bosses are really, really challenging and take time with increase in skill to defeat.
- Controls are tight
- Sound & music is nice, ambiental

Still didn't finish the game, but I am having a really good time playing through it.

Doesn't invent anything new for the genre, but from my perspective and taste, this is Metroidvania done right.

As a comparison, it is much better game than Blasphemous, which has nice art, but the world, lore, and the game itself is generally boring and too much in your face with ""though hath sinned"" kind of vibe. It felt like a grind to just finish the game and never come back to it...","Nov 7, 2021",9
212,osman,Nintendo Switch,Gaming Age,Critic,"It’s pretty cool to see a port of this relatively obscure action-platformer make its way to consoles nearly 30 years after its original release. My only real complaint is that I wish there was a little more to the overall package in the way of supplemental material, background info, concept or flyer art, cabinet shots, etc. The cheats and enhancements are cool, and borderline necessary considering the overall difficulty of the game, but for the asking price I’d expect just a little more. Depending on how hardcore your love is for 90’s arcade action games you may want to hold off for a sale down the road, but if you have any affection for Strider or games of its ilk, then Cannon Dancer – Osman will likely be right up your alley.","Apr 13, 2023",75

Я, як українець, просто не маю права ігнорувати проблеми своїх співгромадян в такій важкій ситуації. Та й вважаю несправедливою оцінку, яку гра має зараз.

This review covers the PS5 version of the game, and it’s worth noting that the framerate didn’t feel entirely smooth. This is of course not super important for an adventure game, but the style of the game paired with the power of the PS5 should have resulted in a smoother experience, which leads me to believe the issue is down to optimization.

While combat was not something I got into, it is different and a unique take, and could be seen as refreshing to the right person.

471,omen of sorrow,PlayStation 4,XxpabloxX27,User,"I personally enjoyed Omen of Sorrow, though sometimes the mobility and generally speaking the ""fells"" of the game may seem a but odd, it is definitely a minor issue. Plus you cannot expect a KoF or MK, mainly because it is neither of those games. I find the approach that AOne took really enjoyable, and it is indeed the company's first game. The horror theme is pretty unplored in the realm of fighting games, so seeing a ""new"" company take the initiative in this field is pretty amazing, besides their first try was not to shabby. Taking everything into consideration as think this is as best as it can get, after they fix all the bugs in the game of course. And i think everyone would appreciate a free DLC in the mix too.","Nov 9, 2018",10

474,not for broadcast,PC,Hardcore Gamer,Critic,"Rarely do you find games these days that could be described as a combination of “ambitious,” “thought-provoking,” “hard-hitting,” “hilarious” and “extremely fun,” but somehow Not For Broadcast delivers on that front. It’s truly a unique gem with terrifically-varied gameplay, a perfectly-absurd sense of humor with impressive writing and performances, and a story guaranteed to throw you for a loop. Not For Broadcast is a bizarre masterpiece and one not afraid to gleefully mock everything it sees in the most over-the-top yet devastating ways possible, and for that, it deserves top honors.

477,not for broadcast,PC,GVB,User,"When I decided to buy it I wasn't very convinced. The gameplay seemed original, at least, and it didn't seem like it was going to be too silly... What I found, however, was surprising. In every sense. The story is very well written and manages to mix very emotional moments with others typical of a Monty Python movie, and the game treats you as an adult and intelligent person capable of drawing your own conclusions.

As for what some critics say that there are segments that are too long, I barely remember two or three of those, and I think they put it there intentionally (to explain why would be spoiler). And if you're worried that the game is too difficult, there are several difficulty levels that allow you to just focus on the story.

But if I had to highlight just two things, it would be:

-The decisions, which are interesting to make and have real consequences in the story. This is seen above all in the segments between programs, where, depending on a thousand factors, you can decide in the protagonist's life and in his relationship with his family. And,

-The characters. A 10 to all of them, with special mention to Jeremy Donaldson. Brilliant, like the rest of the game.

So, if you are really looking for something different, mature, fun and exciting, buy it, play it, enjoy it.","Jan 26, 2023",10

While the abilities Ogden can collect do mix things up a bit when it comes to combat, the patterns of enemies make things just a little too simplistic, while at the same time frustrations around the fluidity of controlling Ogden increase that.

If a generational style of play does interest you, however, then The Sims 4 Growing Together will be exactly what you’re looking for. It brings much more (very needed) depth to the systems already in-game, with new likes and dislikes, Milestones, and Family Dynamics fleshing out how your Sims interact with one another.

I am a firm believer that simulation games, at their best, teach you about real-world jobs, processes, and social/cultural/environmental dynamics, whether that be flying a plane, driving a train, running a hotel or building a city.

The music is simply beautiful and the graphics are amazing for a city builder sim game. Control wise it can be a little quirky as the game was obviously designed for mouse and keyboard, but they did a good job making it work well enough on console. I can't comment on how fun the multiplayer is because I've sat in matchmaking for over 5 minutes several times and gave up, but it's a pretty niche game for console players so I expected that. Overall the game is probably an ""8"" for me so far, but giving it a ""10"" because anyone giving the game a ""0"" just because they apparently had to use an email to play the free demo is simply a ridiculous thing to trash a game over in 2023.

demanding, although it does not escape the sense of repetitiveness inherent in the
works of its genre. It highlights the excellent work that has been carried out in the
system of skills improvements and levels rise, but it is dazzled by a multiplayer section
still pending some improvements in its servers, although it has been on track since its
launch. With a new mode at the end of the main campaign, the options for those who wish
to stay are endless. Undoubtedly, one of the surprises of this beginning of the year that,

The hand-to-hand combat focus is good, although it takes a lot of experimentation to do everything right. The world is intriguing and surprising, especially when it comes to character and enemy design. This is a hard game and any sentient enemy can become a big problem fast. But the biggest issue with the game is how confusing it can be to move through the world, especially when doubling back through already known areas.

640,clash artifacts of chaos,PC,OnurK,User,"As a Zeno Clash lover at first I was sceptical when this game came out. The art style was completely different and the game did not feel surreal as it was in the first two game. But the more I played the more I started thinking  that this game is much much better, of course Zeno Clash series and this game has their own uniqueness and they are good in their own way. But this game is a level up. I've known ACE Team since my childhood, Zeno Clash was my first introduction of their work. I've never thought that there would be another game of Zeno and seeing this game makes me happy.

Gameplay and other technicalities:
- Combat is definitely different than one Zeno has but this doesn't mean it is bad. The combat was really enjoyable because of the smoothness and variations of combos. Dd not feel repetitive at all. The cartoonish sound effects didn't feel right at first but it is actually fitting to the new style and is fun.

Story and other designs:
-The story is quite touching, it gets you more emotional the more you hear about the characters, you feel connected to the characters very quickly. Map design is top notch work and the colors are magnificent. I don't remember how many times I have stopped to watch the view and inspect the details. The dialogues weren't perfect as it was a bit lacking in depth, the characters stay very flat when their story telling ends shortly but the voice acting is just perfect especially for main character Pseudo. Pseudo's design and voicing couldn't be more perfect, his voice fits the character like a glove.

Music:
-My favorite of this game is... the AMAZING music! Even most of the AAA games can't get it right. Patricio Meneses is a legend for this. Sometimes the melodies sooth you and tell you stories and sometimes amazes you and gives you chills with it's epicness. The whole album is gonna be on my list to listen to. Words aren't enough to describe the music. Masterpiece!

Issues of the game in case developers read:
1 - The game doesn't tell you what exactly the night body sequence is, who are they? What are they? I would say it doesn't make any sense, but we don't even have any information about them besides The Boy's explanation towards the end of the game. I was a little disappointed at the end when I learnt nothing about it.
2 - Cutscenes sometimes feel lacking due to some reasons: Low ambiance support, weak and short dialogue.
3 - Sometimes the music doesn't play for several minutes and you are being left with empty running/walking. I'm guessing its a bug, it wasn't a big deal but it was definitely noticable.
4 - The UI is a little weak and bland. You can't save recipies, you have to keep trying combinations to get it right which leads to loss of ingredients. You can't access stat information through inventory (only possible at the camp feature)","Sep 7, 2023",6.7

Also I think that combat system is really, really great because it's simple to play but hard to master, and it have this stiffness that is sometimes need in a games.

Like a cunning crone, developer Pupuya Games have skillfully combined seemingly disparate ingredients to create something magical. Still, genre veterans may find themselves put off by the lack of challenge to be found in the title's beginning hours, and the stark contrast between its whimsical protagonist and the grim world she inhabits can admittedly, at times, be a bit jarring. If these things don't bother you and you're a fan of Souls-likes who's looking for something more forgiving, or perhaps a bit cuter than what you'd usually expect from the genre, Little Witch Nobeta is sure to leave you under its spell.","Mar 12, 2023",65

It is wonderfully crafted, offers compelling choices between “right” and “wrong,” and gives curious players a few hidden pathways beyond those binaries. Its worlds are compact and homespun. It is not a galaxy of content, but in a world full of corporate bloat, overlong working hours, console wars, and games as a service, all I can say is thank goodness for that.","Aug 21, 2023",72

Here, it's all about parry, martial arts and spells, in a novel approach for the genre.

775,horace,Nintendo Switch,mabster,User,"I thoroughly enjoyed this game. I've passed it by a number of times, and glad I finally picked it up during a sale. The game is definitely worth it's full price.

The gameplay is a platformer where the ""gimmick"" is that the robot can walk along the walls and ceiling. When oriented on a wall, for example, gravity will act toward the wall. At first this is quite disorienting but you get used to it. It makes for some interesting level design, with the designers using the orientation to great effect. It's similar to Super Mario galaxy in terms of gravity shifting, but plays quite differently because gravity tends to act at 90 degree increments.

I found the story very heartwarming. The robot protagonist is almost child-like. The robot will not quite understand the adult things happening around him. The story is very British and I chuckled a number of times at the humour. The ""voice acting"" is all narrated by the robot with a varying pitch English robot voice. The supporting characters were all quite different and memorable. I really enjoyed the ending, it was a great wrap up to the story.

The game was quite expansive. It is a Metroidvania game (with addition abilities and backtracking), linear in story (divided into chapters).","Sep 3, 2021",10

784,octopath traveler ii,Nintendo Switch,RPGamer,Critic,"An amazing array of excellent features carried over from the first title, as well as multiple improvements both asked for by fans and added by the creative team at Acquire, lead Octopath Traveler II to be one of the most enjoyable lengthy titles I’ve played in years. Even during some small moments of grinding needed during my 70+ hours, the battle system, sidequests, and character customization always kept me fully engaged in the story and what I was experiencing. There’s little doubt that turn-based RPG fans will find incredible satisfaction from the title, and those who enjoy expansive lore and deep, customizable job systems will fall head-over-heels in love.","Mar 9, 2023",84
785,octopath traveler ii,Nintendo Switch,Pocket Tactics,Critic,"If you like the first entry, a series of smart improvements mean there’s a very good chance you’re going to love Octopath Traveler II. This is still a grand, and traditional JRPG adventure, so get ready for nearly 100 hours of turn-based battles and deep, intricate stories. However, with dynamic visuals, addictive combat, and a deep and intertwining story that features all eight of your characters, Octopath Traveler II is an utterly sublime JRPG experience and now sits as one of the best of its kind on Nintendo Switch.","Feb 16, 2023",90
786,octopath traveler ii,Nintendo Switch,mnm5551,User,"Octopath Traveler II is one of those once in a generation games where you will feel all the varied myriad emotions of joy, sorrow, sadness, melancholy, happiness and empathy. The journey is the true star here instead of the destination. The destination is predestined but the journey, my god what a journey it was, The 8 protagonists here will truly make you believe in all the good things in life like gratitude, redemption and finally hope and that my friends is what very few games can deliver. Play the game it will truly bring a genuine smile on your face from the heart. And as Partitio says Thankee Kindly for reading.

787,octopath traveler ii,Nintendo Switch,sunshinehairpin,User,"This one is my PERSONAL game of the year. So many quality of life features were added since the first game and the changes to all the classes kept many players on their toes when they were making their strategies. The new characters are all very charming, and the newly added interactions between them only made the overall story that much better. The art style is beautiful especially if you're really into pixel art. You'll even find quite a few details just with the world sprites. The new world is fantastic. Being able to travel on water is another new feature, and it delivers very well. The music is as good as its ever been too. If you're a fan of old-school RPGs this game and its predecessor are Must-Plays. I can only see this series getting better as time goes on.","Oct 21, 2023",10

I wish there was more information on the rules and even gameplay tips, though, as well as more gameplay customization options.

819,blood bowl iii,PC,GamingTrend,Critic,"The game is rather complex, with plenty of ins and outs to uncover and learn. It is undoubtedly challenging for newbies and can be overwhelming at first. However, you will eventually figure it out if you give the game a chance and don't get discouraged immediately. Once you get the gist of it, matches are engaging and gratifying, and you will be compelled to play over and over again.Blood Bowl 3 is not yet another turn-based RPG or rogue-like deck-building game. It is a rare mix of turn-based fantasy strategy and sports that requires relentless dedication. However, its significant emphasis on turn-based strategy, its fantasy theme, its Warhammer setting, and its extensive use of gore and violence may intrigue gamers who may not enjoy sports games at first but love tabletop-inspired games. Whatever the case, Blood Bowl 3 is worth trying; you may discover a rich, thrilling game that stands out with its bloodlust.","Apr 30, 2023",57

821,blood bowl iii,PC,fast-foodeur,User,"Bon déjà pour commencer j'adore ce jeu! Je l'attendais avec impatience et enfin il est arrivé, oui même après plusieurs reports qui devenait de plus en plus inquiétant pour le développement, je ne baissait pas les bras et me dire qu'on allait bientôt pouvoir y mettre les mains dessus et c'est le cas! Bon pour commencer le jeu nous offre une grosse campagne bien garnie que malheureusement je n'ai jouer seulement peu de temps, mais qui a l'air assez complet et plutôt riche pour un jeu de ce genre et qui en plus est beaucoup, énormément, extrêmement et j'en passe des adjectifs plus poussé que blood bowl 2 mais pour le moment de ce que je constate la campagne pourrait durer presque une petite dizaine d'heures ce qui n'est pas négligeable comparé a blood bowl 2 que elle ne durait que quelques heures dans mes souvenirs. Les graphismes, j'adore les graphismes de ce jeu ils sont presque à couper le souffle oui certes c'est pas réaliste comme blood bowl 2 mais c'est plus cartoon, plus vibrant et plus coloré ce qui me donne toujours plus envie de garder l'oeil à l'écran mais je sait que il y a une partie qui préfère le côté plus réaliste de blood bowl 2 mais bon il faut au moins plaires à d'autres personnes. La customisation nous promet d'être énorme à partir de la saison 1 et les saisons futures et année futures pour l'instant la customisation est très limitée comme par exemple pour l'instant nous avons seulement droit à 1 Cheerleaders ou 3 coachs ce qui n'est pas énorme pour l'instant je vous l'accorde mais tout la customisation va grandir grâce au passe de combat qui s'appelle le malepierre qui j'imagine va coûter plus de 10$ et qui va faire grincer des dents je n'en doute même pas car si vous n'achetez pas le passe de combat vous allez rester très limitée dans votre customisation du personnage, Cheerleaders, coachs, terrains, tribune etc.... Pour ce qui est de l'IA je l'avoue elle est nul mais vraiment trop nul et je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs, Cyanide nous avait promis une IA améliorée et intelligente qui serait meilleur que blood bowl 2 mais elle est franchement , elle fait de la , dans une partie que c'est à en mourir de rire, à voir si ils vont l'améliorer, dans mon scénario je pense qu'ils vont essayer de l'améliorer a travers des mise à jour mais qui ne sera jamais abouti à avoir une bonne IA, et dans mon cas à moi je m'en fous un peu de l'IA car je joue seulement avec en mode campagne et de temps en temps dans le mode ligue pour m'améliorer un peu car je préfère largement jouer avec un vrai joueur mais je peux comprendre la déception des joueurs solo en ligue. Du côté de la bande sonore c'est un délice pour mes oreilles les sons sont excellents musique très bonne et bande sonore très agréable rien à redire dessus. Encore une fois je comprends la déception des joueurs car la plupart des options quasi obligatoire pour jouer comme par exemple mettre sur pause quand on joue en ligne dans le mode ligue qui va seulement arriver à la saison 2 de l'année 1 je peux comprendre le mécontentement qui devrait y être déjà disponible à la sortie du jeu. Pour conclure c'est mon préféré blood bowl largement meilleur que le 2 selon moi avec du contenu qui devrait sortir sur le jeu pour encore plusieurs et plusieurs années ce qui fait que le jeu sera encore plus supporté et mis à jour que blood bowl 2 est une bonne nouvelle selon moi et qui permet aussi à de nouveaux joueurs de pouvoir embarqué dans cet univers car oui lui au moins permets aux nouveaux joueurs de bien pouvoir apprendre et être moins perdu que les anciens blood bowl qui était moins friendly. Et oui encore une fois je comprends la grosse déception des joueurs mais je crois au moins fermement que la plupart des trucs que les gens grognent vont être réglés et oui blood bowl 2 aussi n'était pas parfait à sortie donc je crois vraiment qu'on devrait lui accorder un peu de temps et de chances car je crois vraiment qu'il a un énorme potentiel. Donc oui foncez le prendre, au prix qu'il coûte je crois pas qu'il vaut la peine d'attendre une promotion pour ceux qu'il veulent l'essayer donc je vous dis bon blood bowl et c'est l'heure du match!!!","Feb 23, 2023",1.6

899,the light brigade,PlayStation 5,fwejio4kl,User,"Title: **A Refreshing, Engaging VR Experience**

Score: **9/10**

""Light Brigade"" is a game that truly shines in the realm of VR. After spending over 50 hours immersed in its compelling world and conquering the final boss on the highest difficulty level, I can confidently say that this title is well worth your time.

The game's ambiance stands out, enveloping players in a world that is both thrilling and beautifully rendered. Every class offers its unique advantages, adding depth and diversity to the gameplay experience. The controls are responsive, ensuring an effortless and enjoyable interaction with the virtual world.

One of the standout features of the game is its replayability. The pursuit of leveling up all the classes keeps you coming back, making every new run feel fresh and challenging.

However, the game is not without its shortcomings. Despite playing at the highest difficulty, I found that it was too easy to stay covered and use the magic wand to eliminate enemies from a safe distance. I would have appreciated a more aggressive AI that could actively seek to flush me out from cover.

Another minor issue is with the game's economy. In the daily runs, I often found gold keys with no apparent use. Similarly, after leveling up sufficiently, I ended up accumulating a surplus of coins with no way to spend them. It would be great to see more avenues to utilize these resources in future updates or iterations of the game.

Despite these minor flaws, ""Light Brigade"" is an exceptional VR experience that I highly recommend. Its engaging gameplay, unique class system, and impressive ambiance make it a standout title in the PSVR2 lineup.","May 21, 2023",7.5

Graphics look incredible on the PSVR2, and just paddling up to some rocks and then pushing yourself away with the end of the paddle feels so weirdly real that I can't really describe it.

Highly recommend using a mop (with the head removed of course) or something similar and some zip-ties for the full experience!

As well as being brilliantly immersive, the graphics are among the best I have ever seen on any headset I have tried and testament to the expertise and passion that the developers have put in to creating this masterpiece.
There is nothing to compare it to on my Xbox Series X for obvious reasons but, to my surprise, I actually prefer the PSVR2 to my Oculus Quest 2 even when tethered to my 3090 PC, it is just that good. I would say the graphics are on par with the PC but look even better on the oled screens that the PS5 version has available.
I must admit that I did experience a fair bit of nausea initially with this title but, after playing around with the accessibility options, I have found a nice comfort level and don't get such issues anymore so well worth experimenting with if you experience similar discomfort.
I would not hesitate to recommend this title and would go as far as to say that every PSVR2 owner should buy it. Fantastic.","Feb 22, 2023",8

Yes, there are similarities to other games in the genre, but the rush of adrenaline and existential dread felt throughout the game are just small factors in what ultimately sets it apart.

With an incredible level of quality paired with a reasonable price of admission, this should absolutely be one of the first titles that anyone interested in making the most out of their new PlayStation VR headset buys.

No matter how frustrating it does get, I kept on playing until I finished the segment  I kept messing up on. The level and boss design are beautiful, and the environment around you just fills you with this existential dread that's just hard to resist.

The character design is mildly interesting, and the soundtrack is occasionally passable, but beyond that the game is simply not enjoyable. The concept of firing from a drone is somewhat unique, but the implementation is terrible and you never really feel connected to your character. The game has the illusion of fast paced combat - screens filled with projectiles - but more often then not you're just sitting still and directing your shots, waiting for the target to blow up. it's even worse when you're trying to play with two or more players, since you'll frequently find that only one person will be visible on the screen, or you get caught screen-scolling back and forth between areas like an old 8-bit game. The game is not expensive, and younger children who don't know any better may be distracted enough by the bright visuals to not realize they're playing a really poorly implemented action platformer, but you're probably better off saving your pennies for a better game.","Dec 30, 2019",2

1105,wanted dead,PC,IGN France,Critic,"Nice try. Wanted: Dead disappoints in every aspect, and it’s heartbreaking. You can see there’s an amazing game right there. But the gameplay is not precise enough to be fun. The game doesn’t have the time to tell the story of its goofball characters: it’s so short you’ll feel it hasn’t really started when you’re done with it.","Feb 13, 2023",60
1106,wanted dead,PC,tim_cusack08,User,"Wanted:Dead is a very fun throwback action title but it comes with fundamental design flaws like a goth kid in school trying to look normal among his peers. Wanted:Dead is a not a normal game, not by a long shot. Very recently I played Valkyrie Elysium made by the same developer and both games feel very similar in terms of blandness. Valkyrie Elysium is a conservative RPG with good story and decent gameplay but it falls flat when creativity comes into play. There’s no creativity In Valkyrie Elysium, it feels tamed, most likely restricted by Square Enix. Like many other Square Enix titles these days, Valkyrie takes no chances and therefore loses its ability to wow.

Wanted:Dead tries hard to be normal and very boring and stay in its lane but occasionally pulls the leash and delivers insane amounts of creatively satisfying content. The story is barely there and it’s very hard to follow and I was bored by the cutscenes until suddenly some artistic spark started coming out of the scenes at the cantina or the scene at the noodle bar. These moments make the game shine bright with charm and personality. Insane executions while wearing cat ears, face smudged in blood and then a quick smoke if you leave the controller idle. Real joy mixed with anger from the final mission that drags on forever.

As a note I want to add that this game deserves way more love that it gets. Wanted:Dead is far from mediocre and this game has balls to be different in the day and age when all games are standardised and measured to feel exactly the same.

1107,wanted dead,PC,saulter,User,"About time we talk Wanted: Dead here. Truth to be told I created this account to talk about Wanted: Dead. I never post reviews online. Never, ever. This is the first time I will openly talk about a game that left an impression on me. This is probably what bipolar disorder feels like. I have been psychologically molested by Soleil and 110 Industries and it was one of the most memorable and amazing experiences in games I had in the past 5 years. Sometimes a game comes along and you buy it because of the cover art. This is how I did it. I have never seen a pink cover art on an action game before in my life. Nobody did. This is new. I come home and I start playing. My first impression is very bad. I don’t understand any of this and the game is brutally hard. First mission, I’m still not sold on it but I keep playing because I don’t know why. Usually I just toss the game if it ****. Wanted: Dead didn’t **** at all but I just couldn’t get it. I stopped playing a lot of games mid way because they are boring. I’m looking at you God of War Ragnarok. Wanted: Dead has a fraction of GoW’s production values but somehow it keeps you entertained. Then I spent two hours picking toys in a crane game. Yes, I’m still talking about Wanted: Dead. Then I reached August and I felt like I was going to quit but when I finally kicked his ass it was a scream of joy. My GF ran into the living room to see what’s up. Then you are treated to a karaoke sequence that is real karaoke. Do you remember Just a Friend bit from Saints Row? This is exactly it but playable. Then Space Runaway. It’s an actual 16-bit SHMUP. Not a level or something. An actual arcade game was made for Wanted: Dead and when I unlocked it, I spent hours trying to beat it. Wanted: Dead surprises you every minute. The combat really opens up on the second mission when you progress further down the skill tree. The executions are gory and fun. There’s also a chainsaw. This game is a collection of randomized chaotic ideas all put together. It should not work but somehow it does and it’s a lot of fun. I’m on my second play through now.

It has a clear theme and manages to make the dating elements, especially for the initial speedy encounters, feel fleshed out. There are some interactions that feel forced and a few changes of tone that miss the mark. But this is a competent romantic narrative with light gameplay. The game wisely allows players to skip the sequences they have already seen, which makes it easy to explore most if not all the story branches.

1117,boyfriend dungeon,Nintendo Switch,TheLinkgirl,User,"At a time where roguelites are becoming increasingly tiresome due to their inherent lack of design, it's fair to say that the best roguelites are the ones that circumvent that shortcoming, commonly by injecting another genre into the formula. As rhythm games, card games and Metroidvanias have become almost overused, one clever developer thought **** idea: a dating game.

Inclusivity is certainly the name of the game with Boyfriend Dungeon, allowing for relationships to be as intimate as you'd like. Some characters are non-binary, and the game allows you to date as you want to; polyamory is totally allowed, but you don't have to. Gameplay bounces between two simple ideas, one where the player goes on dates, and one where the player dives into simple combat in simple dungeons. While both ideas are perfectly fine in their own right, it's the combination of the two that makes Boyfriend Dungeon work so well, with dates unlocking new abilities for weapons in combat, and combat unlocking dates.

While there isn't a massive amount of content, I feel Boyfriend Dungeon has the perfect amount for a playthrough and then some. It was totally worth it for me just to experience all the characters in the way I wanted to.","Sep 5, 2022",6.5

The characters are fun and decently developed, the dungeon gameplay is a lot of fun (similar-ish to Hades'), and the story is good enough to rely on fun character interactions. It also fills a niche that doesn't really exist - a bisexual dating sim.

The game is short though and I wish there were more than 2 dungeons, because I enjoyed playing them so much.

You will find yourself lost in the stories and beautiful artwork, then find yourself lost in a complex beautiful puzzle communicating with friend. Then the satisfaction of finishing the puzzle, while admiring the great animation and surroundings around you. This addition was the first to be more story forward, throwing you in the middle of various cut scenes as a mere fly on the wall, yet sometimes being used as a piece of the story. While playing this game, I felt fully submerged inside the game. It gives you time to reflect on the story and you truly  get the sense that you are apart of it, and what you are doing matters in the story.

The minor control issues and changes are a bit disappointing, but a few patches could be applied to fix these. It does retain the original collections very bland presentation and menu system, so it tends to feel more like a DLC add-on than a whole new collection. However it’s a vast improvement over the previous one. If you own the original release, you owe it to yourself to delete that one and pick this one up. If you skipped the first one, then this is the one that you need to get.

Pros: Game is challenging, but not too hard. I felt it was just right. There isn't too much hand holding. The game encourages exploration. It's very quest driven. You can literally spend like 5 hours in a city doing all the quests, looting all the houses, finding all the secrets. The island is very large and you can spend a good amount of time just mowing down enemies.

Cons: Graphics are horrible. A lot of the game is pointless. There is very little reward in exploration. You can get most of your top tier jewelery crafted by the 2nd chapter. There isn't very many sets of armor. The stat system is very bland and simplistic. The worst things about this game are the bugs and there are MANY!

Each act is divided into several episodes.  Beautiful landscapes and polished maps.  Incredibly huge hordes of zombies to kill.  Even bigger than those in Days Gone.  And this climate.  And what's really cool is the lot of randomness in the game.  Sometimes you have to approach the episode several times because it is difficult (we play on level 3 of difficulty 5 - at the beginning I recommend playing on level 1, even if you have already played some FPS), but thanks to the randomness, each episode can surprise you every time.

1622,river city girls 2,Nintendo Switch,Promotheus,User,"I thought the first game was awesome and a breath of fresh air. I’m not a big beat ’em up-fan, but RCG reinvented the genre and made it much less repetitive.

Part Deux as it were is more than anything more of the same, which is fine. I feel generally that the quality is less inspired than in the first one over the board. The biggest problems are the much lower framerate and the long loading times. Going from a smooth 60 fps to 30 is a considerable downgrade. I can’t for the life of me understand why this was done though, this is a pixel art game, same goes for the loading times. I seriously doubt this is something a patch can fix. Highly suspect it’s poor optimization which would be tied to the source code.

Here are some other improvements I’d like to see:

* A reworked map. You have to look at the map a lot, there really should be a mini map on the HUD. And often the map does not correspond to how the game works. There will be an exit to the side when it’s actually on top etc.

* A cancel button. When doing the ”combos” by repeatedly pressing punch, you can often tell that you are going to get hit long before it happens.

I loved the music in the first game and listened to it long after I had stopped playing the game. There is nothing wrong with the music in RCG 2, but it doesn’t have the banger factor that the first one had.

It’s nice with new characters, but I would’ve liked at least one more womanly character. The ones we got now are both butch. Bosses are fine but they are more about dodging and getting your pot shots in, than a straight up fist fight. If you liked the first one definitely check RCG 2 out.","Dec 20, 2022",7
