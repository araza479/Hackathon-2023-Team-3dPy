583,Door_to_Light_95,"September 13, 2023 at 11:56 am PDT","Spyro on the original PS1 was one of the first games I ever played. As such, the series is incredibly special to me. This article was a great read, and I enjoyed reading the remarks and comments of both the Insomniac and Toys for Bob staff. I also absolutely loved how Toys for Bob remastered the original three Spyro games. I‚Äôm so incredibly thankful that they put so much care and effort into making sure the remastered versions were so faithful to the originals. It was such a wonderful experience replaying through these games I experienced as a kid, and having just as much fun doing so. One thing I have always found special about Spyro (and one of its biggest advantages) is that you get to play as a dragon for crying out loud! Even to this day, there‚Äôs not many games where you play as a dragon. Spyro has always been special because of that. And of course, it‚Äôs fun and appealing gameplay, charming and entertaining characters, incredible music, and how well it manages to succeed in giving that collectathon vibe that 3D platformers are known for. Happy 25th anniversary, Spyro! (As a side note, I know Activision is getting closer and closer to being bought by Microsoft. I know the likes of Spyro and Crash Bandicoot aren‚Äôt as huge of games as Call of Duty, but I still hope that as Microsoft has said Call of Duty will remain multiplatform, that the likes of Spyro can as well. I‚Äôm okay with Microsoft owning Activision, and I honestly think my two childhood friends, Spyro and Crash Bandicoot, are in much safer hands being owned by Microsoft than just Activision in its current state. Activision has been having a lot of internal difficulties in recent years, and I think Spyro and Crash are in a safer home with Microsoft if the deal goes through. That being said, I sincerely hope that Spyro and Crash can still be multiplatform games ‚Äî especially if we get new Spyro and Crash games going forward. Having them at least available on PlayStation would be wonderful, considering the significant history that Spyro and Crash have with PlayStation. I‚Äôm totally all for Spyro and Crash being played by more people, across all platforms. I just hope that PlayStation gamers can still have access to potential new Spyro and Crash games in the future too. Regardless, though, happy 25th anniversary Spyro! I hope to see you star in a new game soon, and I am forever thankful for all the memories I cherish with you throughout the years!)",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/13/spyro-at-25-insomniac-games-and-toys-for-bob-celebrate-25-years-of-spyro-the-dragon/

Many of the games that I have played since then have usually induced stress in one way or another (like turn-based strategy games toward the end with nigh hour-long final boss fights/army skirmishes, racing simulators with incredibly skilled opponents, etcetera). For me, there was never any stress or cause for concern with Spyro games (unless you were trying to get a platinum trophy with the Reignited Trilogy and defeat Ripto without getting hurt once). Each day, I could just relax, explore, and collect things. I don‚Äôt think that there could be a better gaming experience than that (although, I do realize that this is just my opinion). It was quite soothing. Everything about the games was phenomenal, but I was most impressed by the music. I found and downloaded the soundtrack for all of the games online 11 years ago or so, and I still listen to those songs to this day. Stewart Copeland did an amazing job composing the music for this series! I‚Äôve heard rumors that a new Spyro game might be in development, and I recall seeing a few Spyro Easter eggs in Crash Bandicoot 4. While I hope that a new Spyro game is in development, whether or not that is the case, I will also be a huge fan of Spyro for the games that he has already starred in.

The scale offered by Hello Games supporting full-game VR for NMS has always been beyond reproach, but the visual sharpness (particularly in the mid-distance and beyond) has maybe just held it back from breaking through the top-tier of PSVR2 games. If HG have managed to crack that here‚Ä¶ I really need to try this update when I get home! And as always, the other updates are a mix of improvements, iterations and reimaginings that partly offer the playerbase cool things they were asking for and partly offers even cooler things they‚Äôd never thought about. Everyone knows the story of NMS by now, but Hello Games continue to build their exemplary reputation for post-launch support. Happy seventh birthday, Sean.

682,Moftwell,"August 25, 2023 at 9:53 am PDT","Quick explainer of how time works for MrXile: The state of a game at launch is a result of work done prior to launch. Improvements made to a game after launch is a result of work done after launch. This concept is pretty basic. Yep, we all know how the game was during that first year. But by that point the developers had begun working on the post-launch improvements. NMS launched seven years ago. Thus, it has been seven years of amazing work to reach the point the game‚Äôs at now, and it‚Äôs possible to hold both that opinion and the opinion that the game wasn‚Äôt good on release. Seems weird to consider ‚Äòthey made the game better now than it was at launch‚Äô as blinkered, but I get it; words can be difficult.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/24/no-mans-sky-celebrates-its-7th-anniversary-with-its-largest-update-of-the-year-echoes/

I know that it‚Äôs probably not the highest priority, but I think it would still be beneficial to add a few more options to offline local multiplayer. The 2 player offline multiplayer is good as it stands now, but it would still be really nice to see some updates to the local multiplayer, even though it‚Äôs not as popular as online multiplayer. One suggestion would be to allow the screen for each player in splitscreen to hide the UI and allow the game itself to fill the entirety of each player‚Äôs screen. Having that UI with all the neat stats and indicators is a nice option, but I don‚Äôt think having it as the only option for 2 player offline races is all that great. I for one, would love to play a 2 player offline race with a friend on the couch without the busy UI surrounding each player‚Äôs side of the screen. It kind of makes the area of the screen with the actual race going on rather small and more difficult to see in my opinion. It would be nice to be able to have an option for each player‚Äôs side of the screen in splitscreen to fill the entirety of the screen too, for those of us who want to play local couch races without the UI taking up so much screen space. I know this probably isn‚Äôt the highest priority, but even though online multiplayer is so big nowadays, there‚Äôs still quite a lot of people like me who also enjoy local multiplayer with friends in person too. Having some additional options added to the 2 player offline multiplayer would still be a worthwhile addition in my opinion, even though online multiplayer is the much bigger focus.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/04/gran-turismo-7-update-1-36-adds-4-new-cars-three-extra-menus-and-a-gran-turismo-movie-experience/

858,martnata,"August 6, 2023 at 11:09 pm PDT","It‚Äôs nice to get new vehicles, but GT7 DESPERATELY needs new single-player racing events on the tracks already in the game, with payouts inline with the winning + clean-race-bonuses of Circuit de la Sarthe & SPA endurance races. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, new tracks will be awesome and I‚Äôd even like to see the Goodwood FOS hill-climb event make a return. A SOPHY race on each track may also create a bit of incentive for single-player enthusiasts if the winning payouts are very decent. Without at the very least the latter, the game is not worth it at all for these players. As it stands I haven‚Äôt played in ages as I‚Äôm tired of grinding the Le Mans track over & over again just so I can buy a new car and look at it in my garage or walk around it with the VR headset. The most expensive 20M classics I don‚Äôt even consider as my time isn‚Äôt that worthless to me. The cars above 10M credits should be at least 80% cheaper! Not sure what the devs plan, but the current trajectory in GT7 will ensure that GT8 is a hard pass on my future shopping list.

927,CommandingTiger,"July 23, 2023 at 7:42 pm PDT","Can we talk about the project Q?Like what even is that?It feels like a split Dualsense with a low end tablet found on Ali Ex-press. It looks very cheap.That thing CANNOT cost more than 150$, 170$ at max if it is just a controller. What are you thinking?We asked for a hybrid console like the Switch but from PlayStation and Thus is what I get?We would have taken a 6 to 7 inch screen, with huge front facing speakers. but you put top facing speakers? ONLY 3 Hours of Battery life?! That‚Äôs because the screen size eats the battery up. The hybrid device we want is basically like the Q-Lite, but you actually attach a powerful Ryzen APU that rivals the PS5 in terms of power, those chips exists. Then you can detach that portion from the Q-Lite and dock it making it a PS5 slim. The dock would have hdmi out, 3 usb 3.1, ethernet, an optical disc drive and a SSD expansion slot.(and aadditional cooling solution) combining both the Q-Lite and PS5 slim would essentially make it a hybrid console you can take on the go.Instead your doing half bad job and turning it into a Wee U only device. The fact it‚Äôs using Android as opposed to a dedicated OS gives me 0 hope for this device being a complete waste. If you‚Äôre not going to make a Switch like hybrid home/mobile console then you might as well cancel it before you‚Äôre forced to sell them for 50$ in a clearance. What we want is a Switch like handheld but with the power of the A s u s R O G Ally.We do NOT want the Logi-tec G-Cloud. The handheld PS5 can be either a home console or a portable device, when it is docked, it gets access to a bigger library of games from digital to physical as well as a performance boost, not draining the battery of the handheld portion, the Q-Lite. The Q-Lite hybrid would retain the touchscreen, unlike the switch that disposes of it when docked. So let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs plugged in the wall, the screen can act as it‚Äôs TV if no TV is available without draining the battery as much while boosting performance.You can charge 500$-600$ for all this portable hybrid console.Price is not a issue, Purpose is.  It all it is, is a controller, then 150$ is more than enough.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/21/share-of-the-week-noir/

And then you look at Xbox and compare their 2020 showcase and in 2023 Halo is a dead franchise, and they put out a horrible Fable cinematic trailer and Avowed gets a MASSIVE cartoony downgrade. The only problem with PlayStation is that we have practically nothing new announced since Horizon, GT7 and God of War Ragnorok launched (or anything us PlayStation fans actually care about and none of that utter gack from that showcase 2 months ago). But why am I wasting my time saying that here on a PlayStation blog the past 2 years since Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart came out? You long stopped caring about what we have to say anymore.

Could even have included that entire library to PS+ Premium to make that service actually worth the asking price. But no. Just PC releases, that‚Äôs all you seeming to care about. When will PS5 see a first party game from a studio that isn‚Äôt insomniac or some unnecessary remaster/remake that actually makes console owners feel the console is half worth a?

1058,HollowKage,"June 22, 2023 at 7:54 pm PDT","I absolutely loved this game, characters, story, game play, and gruesome deaths. Striking Distance Studios created a horror masterpiece. The atmosphere is eerie and untrusting a lot like when you have to make your way through frozen infected biophage pathogens in chapter 5, Lost. The enemies are unique and challenging from the lowly Grunts to the more complicated Security Units. No game is perfect though, for it being a survival horror it relies pretty heavy on the prison baton and the dodge, though both become second nature as you trudge through the infected prison. Their could‚Äôve been better weapon cosmetics and some weapons you need weren‚Äôt available while other weapons you didn‚Äôt need were. I was hoping to wear the suit with helmet more and every gamer should know you guys are the master mind behind the original Dead Space, that being said I expected the suit to work more like Issacs suit in DS, helmet effects anyways. I bought the season pass and I plan on getting Final Transmission soon, here‚Äôs hoping you guys are able to make a second installment and that you guys ultimately are able to make a franchise out of it.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/22/the-callisto-protocol-returns-with-final-transmission-dlc-first-gameplay-details-revealed/

The animations are fairly smooth with some of the directional combat feeling a bit off when not locked on. The worst part is the blocking and dodging. The environment makes it really easy for enemies to corner you, there are tons of little obstructions that cant be broken and you can get stuck really easy because of the weak sidestep dodge. The game encourages blocking but it feels more based on luck than actual timing. First death was on the first boss in the circus. It took hours to beat him because i was focusing on trying to get the block down. You can make it to the first boss without blocking once but then you MUST master it in order to continue. Once i finally beat it i wasnt looking forward to continuing. It was far more frustrating than fun and didnt come with a sense of accomplishment at the end. I didnt even finish the demo.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/08/lies-of-p-demo-available-today-contains-first-two-chapters/
1151,Iozefka,"June 10, 2023 at 5:48 pm PDT","Demo Impressions: *Lore: There isn‚Äôt too much setup or exposition at first, but once you get to Kat Hotel you learn more of the world and it became a more interesting place to explore. It has many similarities in its narrative with Bloodborne; Ergo = Blood Healing,  Ashen Blood = Petrification disease(?). I just hope that it is different enough to establish its own identity. *Combat: Basic and Strong attacks felt good. My main concern so far is the Legion Arm Loadouts never were that useful and there didn‚Äôt seem to be additional attack animations right after dodging or running forward, so the encounters lacked some fluidity. Aside from leveling, the P-Organ (mechanical heart?) progression system may serve to add additional depth, but it is something you only get to try at the end of the demo. As you progress through the game I want to see more creativity for combos and weapons. *Graphics and Level Design: The look and feel of the world feels very polished. You can expect the classic Souls-like shortcuts, being ambushed on narrow alleys and resources hidden around every corner. 0",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/08/lies-of-p-demo-available-today-contains-first-two-chapters/

1155,AdonisIsBeast,"June 11, 2023 at 9:30 pm PDT","This game was literally SO CLOSE, to being a masterpiece based on the demo, but unfortunately they dropped the ball in a few KEY areas. They seriously should consider delaying for one year to fix this: Combat is extremely sluggish, hit boxes are not clear, and if fighting based on bloodborne mechanics (focus on dodging versus blocking), it is extremely frustrating and not fun due to how slow the character moves and how small the hit boxes are (also inaccurate). When dodging bosses and trying to attack afterward, movement is so slow that you cannot get rewarding hits into the enemy ‚Äì it is a slog. And if choosing to block in combat, the frames for when an enemy is open to a perfect block are not clear enough. The game should be difficult as it currently is, but the player should be able to properly study enemy moves a bit better.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/08/lies-of-p-demo-available-today-contains-first-two-chapters/

There was a long stretch of time we didn‚Äôt see demos, they fell off the face of the earth suddenly and it seemed like a long time. Developers (gamers knew without question) were withholding demos of their games in fear you wouldn‚Äôt buy there game when you actually played it, they were worried about the quality and wanted to get ya before you could figure it out. There was this really stupid fiction going around that devs didn‚Äôt want to release demos because they got charged a dime every time someone downloaded the demo and it was too expensive when nobody was buying the game and ya just go: ‚ÄúThen develop and amazing game you, yourself, would want to play instead of cutting corners, actually make a good game.‚Äù So, I‚Äôm happy to see the return of demos, thank you!

There are those who say it sucks, it fell off and left the game. Came back under another screen name, pay their way through higher tiers, and just killing the little and new guys. How come your servers don‚Äôt see and reward those that paid $62 for the game from the beginning and have been thru it all thick and thin? Oh, I know why.. A dollar is a dollar, right? I enjoy TRYING to play this game. But there is nothing for the newcomer to encourage him to keep at it. Newcomers just keep on becoming ‚Äòfeed‚Äô for those who do nothing but feed off of them. But I can‚Äôt wait for season 5. I enjoy playing no matter what.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/26/charge-into-battle-in-battlefield-2042-season-5-new-dawn-deploying-june-7/

Upgrading to the Premium Battle Pass only unlocks additional cosmetic items.‚Äù I do agree with some of your comments regarding showing players that have been a part of the game since launch and have continued playing the game via some special banner next to their name at the minimum show for those that pre-ordered the game especially those that bought the Ultimate Edition.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/26/charge-into-battle-in-battlefield-2042-season-5-new-dawn-deploying-june-7/

Will there be a discounted or Free path to Elite Edition for those that bought the ‚ÄúBattlefield Ultimate Edition PS4 & PS5‚Äù bundle?‚Äì  Many players, including myself, pre-ordered Battlefield 2042 Ultimate Edition at full retail price via Pre Order.‚Äì I have personally pre-ordered Battlefield 2042 Ultimate Edition on June 9th 2021 (when the preorders first went live) and paid the full retail price of $119.99 USD.‚Äì I have played the game nearly every day since launch (November 18th 2021) on my PlayStation 5.As I‚Äôm writing this post there‚Äôs currently no upgrade path on the PS Store or In-Game to upgrade to Elite Edition from Ultimate Edition unless you pay at full retail at $99.99 USD. 2. Will you be bringing ‚ÄúPlatoon‚Äù Support to Battlefield 2042? (both In-game and via Battlelog stats)‚Äì Allowing for other Platoons to compete with each other in-game‚Äì Showing stats of the entire Platoon‚Äì Allowing Communication via Microphone and Text Chat in-game so an entire Platoon can work together as a unit. 3. Proximity voice chat‚Äì  Allowing players to communicate with other teammates in a close range such as calling for a revive, ammo, support such as repairs or calling out an enemy nearby. 4. Squad Management‚Äì Allowing the squad leader to remove/kick a player from the squad that is not contributing to the squad such as a player that‚Äôs AFK or never following squad orders (Sticking together as a squad) 5. More Maps‚Äì commitment in the future to adding more maps to the game 6. Year 2 support‚Äì  commitment in the future to support the game beyond season 5 for game improvements, weapon balances, vehicle balances, new weapons, new vehicles, new cosmetic skins for weapons and vehicles. Battlefield 2042 is just starting to get to a point where it needed to be at launch in regards to smooth gameplay, balances between Infantry and vehicles and all the little things in between but there‚Äôs still work to be done that the community would like to see improved and or added to the game as I mention above some of the big items that I and my Platoon would like to see added to the game.

I really don‚Äôt think the design helps its case: a large screen shoved into the middle of a controller doesn‚Äôt exactly seem ergonomic or portable. The biggest blow for me is the lack of an OLED screen, especially considering the Vita had it nearly 10 years prior.

Although I love the recent announcement of MGS Snake Eater Remake, the gameplay footage of Spider-Man 2, Marathon from Bungie looks cool. I haven‚Äôt played Marathon on PC back in the day, so it‚Äôs looks interesting as Bungie‚Äôs first reboot of a beloved PC classic. Ghost Runner 2 and Phantom Blade 2 looks awesome. The biggest issue is 5 things:1. The appearance of Final Fantasy 16. We already saw the State of Play event on the game, why are you showcasing the game again to remind fans on the game that is coming out June 22?2. Gran Turismo trailer. The trailer just already came out online 3 weeks ago, I‚Äôm looking forward to the film, but can‚Äôt you get a behind the scenes featurette or something? Terrible botch timing to release the same trailer, Sony.3. About Foamstars, what is this? A knock-off of Splatoon (which still continues to have a loyal following on the Switch) and then turn it into a live-service game. What kind of ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù are you talking about Crying Jim? You have learned nothing from what other live-services games failed to live up to their expectations (Babylon‚Äôs Fall, Marvel‚Äôs Avengers, etc.)4. A PlayStation Dualsense Handheld Thingy. You know why VITA fans desperately wants a VITA 2.5. Missing games that weren‚Äôt featured. Death Stranding 2, Tekken 8, Silent Hill 2 Remake, Last Of Us: Factions. Last Of Us is turning 10 years old and now you‚Äôre saying Factions isn‚Äôt getting mentioned on the showcase? All I gotta say is do better, Sony. If you want a better showcase, bring back your live audience. I sorely miss the E3 days with the PlayStation knocking out of the ballpark with fantastic gameplay and huge announcements. Now, they have become a shell of its former glory days. I give the Showcase a C-grade.

1326,KazeEternal,"May 25, 2023 at 12:04 pm PDT","Wifi exclusive Project Q? I got a wishlist for you: 1) Give USB-C hub support for wired Connections. I do this with my phone to get a much more stable connection to my PS5 when remote playing. WiFi in my house is ok and will be getting a Wifi6 overhaul eventually, but my 1gig network is better suited and works great with my PS4 and Phone when remote playing my PS5. 2) Make this sucker have a dock. Not just a charging dock, but a TV dock. I want to be able to dock this device to my TV and allow me to have a full PS5 like experience, using an actual dual sense. No need to go crazy with detachable groups that attach to a controller dock with a touch pad in the middle (though appreciated). If I‚Äôm playing in another room away from my PS5 and the TV suddenly becomes free in that room and I don‚Äôt want to go to the other room, it would be nice to just dock and play. I‚Äôd buy multiples of these docks for each room with a TV if this was a thing.  A lower cost charging dock without all the bells and whistled would be a nice accessory as well. 3) I‚Äôm already asking for Dual Sense support in number 2, so this should be a natural fit. Bluetooth support for multiple devices. Headsets, controllers, keyboards. etc I want it all. Look overall I‚Äôd rather have a PS Vita 2 with backward compatibility with digital PS4 games. If this thing is going to be what I think it is, we‚Äôre looking at a 200 dollar product which is going to make people ask ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just make a Vita 2?‚Äù I doubt it‚Äôll be 100 dollars like the backbone. My little wishlist here will certainly push that price up. So go the distance, don‚Äôt stop short like with the Vita (no tv out and stupid touch screen, zero innovation to adopt Dual Shock 3/4 layout) and PSP (lacking a second analog stick and again no TV out or Dual Shock support till PSP Go which was a dumb move to do to the PSP2000 and 3000).",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/playstation-showcase-recap-everything-announced-at-todays-show/

The Nintendo Switch found a large portion of the market.Having the same Ryzen architecture, having the same/similar powered would be significantly different than running games on an ARM processor directly and forcing development to build from the ground up an entire game, instead to adjust and optimized the existing games at a lower resolution and not ‚Äúexclusive games‚Äù made specifically for that hybrid handheld, it would be instead a hybrid PS5 home/portable console.

I don‚Äôt see how they could be able to make a system as powerful as a PS5 on a mobile device and not charge the same if not more than a PS5. Which is probably why they have this Q Lite as a stand-alone device because you can put in different powered hardware attached to the back of this Q Lite device. So if you‚Äôre only willing to spend 400$, you‚Äôd get a portable device as powerful as a PS4 Pro (that‚Äôs with the Q-Lite), but won‚Äôt play PS5 games.  You want the bigger hardware, then you‚Äôre spending more on this device to get a full PS5 out of it. Then you‚Äôre probably looking at 600$ in total minimum. I totally agree with you that we need a new PSP type device,  Sony however will Not make any other games than their AAA for console nor compromise the experience. However, we‚Äôre not dealing with completely different architecture, it would be all Ryzen and basically run all the same games, except in a portable way. If you just want the Q-Lite, you‚Äôd basically stream games either via Remote Play or Cloud Streaming with PS5 server blades, these are coming down the line so that‚Äôs why they are waiting to show more on the device. Depending if they get the patents, they can make the dual sense controller detachable onto a middle portion holding the touchpad similar to Nintendo Switch. The good thing about the Q-Lite is that you can keep this device and just upgrade the hardware that runs games separately from the 9 inch OLED screen.

I‚Äôm really missing the ps3 days when there was a drought of games after launch and then countless games began to unfold. I enjoyed Resistance Fall of Man‚Äôs multiplayer which kept me busy. Until Motorstorm released and spent a lot of time on that, and then when Warhawk came out that was one of the funnest games I‚Äôve played to date. Even after when CoD4 came out it was fun to keep playing. Then there was Uncharted and then Killzone 2.. and the rest was history. From the time it launched it was being mocked for having ‚Äúno games‚Äù but Sony really pushed hard and brought games that were so fun and exciting. Those were days I missed.. we got a great console and create games don‚Äôt get me wrong..  but it‚Äôs 2023 and there are fewer games that would keep me captivated. I know I‚Äôm beating a dead horse but I really wished they would have brought some older titles such as Motorstorm and Warhawk.. and even Reisistance (the first was the best).

So if I understand correctly, the game will have two completely separate modes, one is a single player action RPG, and then there‚Äôs a 4 player co-op mode that sounds like it‚Äôs separate from the single player story. They mention ‚Äúin single player mode, the CPU controls the other three members of a party, providing vital support‚Äù, does this mean that both modes can actually be played fully offline, or am I misunderstanding how this works? My second question is, how expansive is the single player RPG portion of it, I‚Äôm hoping it isn‚Äôt just a tutorial or something but where most of the game is located. I get the hopes for co-op is probably to make a long lasting service game, but I‚Äôm just not a fan of those kinds of games and I want to make sure there‚Äôs going to be plenty of single player _offline_ content to keep me busy.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/two-new-playable-characters-join-the-granblue-fantasy-relink-roster/

1406,Hellooooo_Nurse-,"May 25, 2023 at 4:54 pm PDT","People keep saying it‚Äôs just a Splatoon clone with a dense small minded outlook. It is very much a Splatoon Clone obviously. So what! That‚Äôs not a bad thing as Splatoon is fun as heck. Playstation doesn‚Äôt have access to anything like Splatoon since it‚Äôs a Nintendo 1st party IP exclusive. We get 3,000 shooters a year that are just like Doom, Halo, Call of Duty, or some zombie apocalypse game. Nobody complains about them being clones or what they are influenced by, they just play them and hopefully enjoy them. We get one Splatoon clone in the history of ever and everyone is outraged smh. Get over it! Keep that same energy the next time a Call of Duty clone or another zombie horde shooter is released. Also, Splatoon 3 has a lot of problems and room to improve. Like constant communication errors and disconnections because of P2P and not dedicated servers. No built in Team Voice chat, No easy invite system, Slowdown framerate issues especially in Salmon Run, lower resolution because of hardware limitations. And not being able to play ranked with your friends to name a few. FoamStars, could deliver a awesome expeirence to Playstation users because it will have the advantage of be powered by a PS5. Where we can at the very least have team voice chat built in and consistent framerates with smoother animations potentially. I love Splatoon and I have played it to a very high level and I will continue to play it. Nonetheless, I am open to this as well on my PS5. If it‚Äôs fun I will play it. If it‚Äôs bad o‚Äôwell it‚Äôs a opportunity missed by the developer. Either way there is enough room in the marketplace for another Splat-Like shooter. I just hope it has Gyro Aim (motion sensor aim) since its mimicking everything Splatoon so closely. Thats one of the most important and iconic features to me of the experience. PS4 and PS5 controllers both support motion aiming. So no excuses to not includeit as a option. I also hope it feels like a proper PS5 game. Not filled with obnoxious micro transactions for every little bit of the game. Or everything being pay walled behind nonsense currencies. I just hope Square Enix sets out to make a fun game.

Some were not born at the time of the original Killzone. Remastering the games and getting people excited would be a good idea. Killzone is an iconic series for PlayStation and has had a strong multiplayer community. It‚Äôs a wonderful candidate for a PlayStation live service multiplayer shooter. Imagine remastering the first game with a multiplayer component that lives with the games. Remaster the second one as the live service multiplayer keeps evolving.

Historically developers have had to stop developing for older platforms because it becomes too difficult to support multiple versions of the same game when one generation of a console can do something that the other cannot, and performance suffers on the older console. I still have to have the PS4 disc in my system to play Forbidden West on My PS5.  Between the changes to the controller and the 4K 120Hz HDR the upgrade to a PS5 is worth it if you can also upgrade the displsy that you are using to play your games.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/09/20-years-of-guerrilla-the-story-of-a-playstation-studio/

On the fourth generation MX-5, they only have the 1.5L softtop, neither of the 2.0L engine, nor the hardtop or the 100th anniversary edition etc‚Ä¶ While the first gen MX-5 is present, it‚Äôs only the 89 version with no second, third generation or special edition models, such as the 30th anniversary edition. On the only recently added 3, it‚Äôs very strange that they only added the hatchback and not the saloon as well, while on older models, the 3 MPS would be nice to have as well‚Ä¶ üòØüòÄü§òü§û *The petrol engines available in Europe are 145hp and 165hp 2.0L engines and an unfortunately automatic only 2.5L 194hp version, which got a turbo in other markets! While as well as this 2.2L 174hp diesel, it was available with 150 and 184 hp as well. Anyway, I hope this changes soon! üòÄü§òü§û",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/26/gran-turismo-7-update-1-32-going-live-today-with-4-new-cars-two-extra-menus-for-gt-cafe-and-scapes-locations/

1683,Hellooooo_Nurse-,"April 21, 2023 at 2:18 am PDT","That is really cool that this game has a retro look, but will still play and feel very modern and clean. I‚Äôm really interested in this game. While all of this is great. Above all, I‚Äôm hoping this game will have quality gyro aiming (motion sensor aiming) implementation for PS4/5 versions of Boltgun as a option. Not just limiting the gyro aim experience to the Nintendo Switch version only.  Or not implementing gyro aim at all. Which will definitely make the game DOA on the Switch for sure. Nonetheless, we PS5 owners want gyro aiming too, as our controller supports it as well. If this game doesn‚Äôt support gyro, unfortunately that is a huge deal breaker for me personally and many others that want this feature added. Hopefully, this game doesn‚Äôt let Quake (Remaster) out class it with quality good feeling gyro aim controls as a option. As Quake has usable functional gyro aiming natively on PS4/5. You know a legit retro shooter with modern control features as a option. Which is awesome! I‚Äôm hoping this game will follow suit and bring a great gyro aiming experience with the proper options in the settings to get it dialed in to the PS4/5 version of the game. Besides, gyro aiming not only enhances gameplay of shooters when implemented correctly. It does it Without the need of aim assist. It also doubles as a huge accessibility feature that makes FPS games possible for many people with various disabilities to be able to play. Not having this feature in the game is insensitive to the needs of those individuals. Hopefully, the devs at Auroch  Digital don‚Äôt screw this aspect up! We‚Äôll see when it‚Äôs released.

1701,CommandingTiger,"April 7, 2023 at 7:57 am PDT","Hey PS.  What are you thinking about this new ‚ÄúQ Lite‚Äù handheld system?  If it‚Äôs just going to be a remote play device, just put out remote play on more Android devices and the Vita and call it a day.  Either way, you need to port Remote play on PS5, the PS Vita can remote play the PS4 and there‚Äôs no reason to do the same with the PS5.If it‚Äôs remote play only, then it‚Äôs DOA.  It needs full PS4 and PS5 compatibility/emulation but at a lower performance. I don‚Äôt think you heard me correctly.  That system only made sense as a ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù controller with Remote Play ability with s bigger battery.That controller would add additional features and functions inside each PS5 exclusive games like inventory management, additional buttons actions, scope shooting zoom in vision for shooters, puzzle solving, RTS ‚ÄúStrategy games‚Äù selecting troops, etc.  It would be better than just a touch pad  It would require software and hardware to save on battery greatly, keep the screen off most of the time for a better battery efficiency  and a much bigger battery. This system only makes sense in a hybrid Handheld/Home console system.  Where instead of ‚Äúremoving the joycons‚Äù, it keeps all of it‚Äôs component, but removes the main system console chip, while keeping the little sister system for smaller tasks and functions. The main system would also have it‚Äôs own dock that would connect to the TV as well as connection itself to additional SSD memory and Blu Ray drive. You can make a Ryzen console with 16Gb of Ram similar to a mobile device like the Asus ROG Ally handheld with more power than the Steam Deck that would rival and surpass the Xbox Series S (since it has more Ram) meaning it would make it easy for third party games to port the game over that if it‚Äôs on Xbox Series S, then it has to release on this handheld system. With Ryzen architecture, it makes it significantly easier to port the games over to the handheld. You would just scale down on this handheld for 1080p, 30fps to 60fps. If you can run Horizon Zero Dawn on the Steam Deck, you can run Forbidden West on a stronger Handheld.It‚Äôs not like with the Vita using an outdated ARM mobile chip with low Ram like the PS3. The architecture is significantly too different and under-powered. This ‚ÄúQ Lite‚Äù would have a dock behind the console to sit the main console board. You‚Äôre still releasing PS4 games and handhelds are now much stronger than a PS4 now.   It would also feature Blue-tooth to connect to a PS5 or the handheld in dock mode. If you are just releasing this system as a remote play only controller, then there is 0 appeal and would be a waste of money for everyone, don‚Äôt waste your money.People can already remote play on their phone and that‚Äôs fine enough.The way it‚Äôs being described, I‚Äôd have to says that it is DOA and won‚Äôt sell well.  You need the whole package.You need to be able to play your PS5 games on the go (and PS4) while lower specs obviously.  It still needs 16Gb of Ram to avoid any memory issues like TLOU P! on  PC.Easy to port, mass appeal in Japan. People want a real handheld and it won‚Äôt affect the PS5‚Äôs graphics at all, just the resolution and fps. It won‚Äôt be having dedicated studios making handheld only games, but rather a handheld that emulates all PS4 and runs PS5 games. There‚Äôs way too many handheld consoles to miss out on the growing market. Also use SD, USB memory, M.2 SSD or traditional type of memory.  NO SONY OWNED MEMORY CARDS! They‚Äôre too expensive and don‚Äôt protect games.Blu-Ray games will need to be scanned once every 4 months or accessed via your PS5 from home to confirm you own that game for disc games.Your efforts to port games on this handheld will be significantly easier than those to port PS5 games to the wide array of PCs running on Windows with DX12.Be smart and it‚Äôll be a success.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/05/players-choice-vote-for-march-2023s-best-new-game/
1702,CommandingTiger,"April 7, 2023 at 8:28 am PDT","The ‚ÄúQ Lite‚Äù must have an OLED with Sony back HDR color calibration options for the screen.It needs replaceable battery similar to the PSP for longevity. By all means, don‚Äôt just send this as a controller with a screen, have it be a hybrid device console that plays PS4/PS5 games and run PS4 games as a PS4 pro mode. If the Q Lite also has an ARM chip, for whatever reason, then it should play PSP/Vita games too.  If that‚Äôs the case. Remote play don‚Äôt always connect as most jobs and public areas legit block access to do so.

I can finally feel the road with my T300 in GT7`s GT3 cars.Catching slides have newer been easier and GT7 is such a joy to race online with this latest update.For the first time it makes more sense to drive with a wheel than a controller. The wheel just felt so dead before but now it feels alive.GT7 is probably the only racing game that master the balance of driving with a wheel or a controller where both feels great.Now i feel the FFB is good enough to think about investing in a PSVR2 headset for the best immersion possible.

Can‚Äôt say I liked much of February‚Äôs games and while PSVR2 is too expensive for me, I have been playing a bit of it at a friend‚Äôs place including half hour today and am actually pretty stunned by how cool it is.    I never cared for VR before but it feels like it‚Äôs getting to the point of technology and game type that I like.

2047,stage300handsome,"March 12, 2023 at 4:08 pm PDT","I see a lot always say we gamer‚Äôs that have grew up with PlayStation since its start have changed, I don‚Äôt agree with that at all. I think studios are the change, they are full of people who are creative, but like Hollywood have run out of ideals for the most part and as a company they are no longer concerned with your feedback on anything, they assume they have your business, and they pander to other crowds that aren‚Äôt really loyal to the brand or experience. Square Enix a great studio, and I‚Äôm looking forward to a lot of their titles, but I think they lost their magic of always coming up with titles that interest the base now because they try to do to much to please western audiences, when in truth the ones that will buy a title preorder or day one are not looking for western styles.And that brings me to the point now with this State of Play that I finally got around to watching because most of them the past yr haven‚Äôt been good or having something your wanting to see, even though Baldur‚Äôs and a few of the other single player rpgs and action adventures looked good , so much pushing the sucide squad and online ones along with the woke stuff, really kind of brought it done. But that is the best thing out what Sony is that during the Ps1 and 2 its was full of any genre you wanted. There‚Äôs still just as much variety as then but they all lean toward the same thing wanting online and free for all.I have two sons who like to game and for the past few yrs its been Fortnite and CoD nonstop back and forth all day that they can, and I have every system from the late 80‚Äôs up to now. And they have sat and played around with them in the past or sat and watched me, it was usually that looks boring or it cheats so bad, looks rough. But now that they have gotten older, I will see them try some different games here and there, and was really shocked to learn they got Legend of Dragoon and Wild Arms and been playing them the past few weeks. But apparently, they didn‚Äôt realize I had the originals. I found out by taking them out to Game Stop and a few local used gaming stores, they were looking where I was looking and I said guys used passed by the C‚Äôs already, then I heard my youngest ask a worker if they  had chrono trigger for Ps4 or 5 and I was like I got that at home if you want to play it, but its not on the newest consoles. They then came up asking questions about others, so they must have been researching or seen others watching their youtube videos on the games they play, I still don‚Äôt get that, but was kind of glad  they were trying some of my favorites now. And for the last month I haven‚Äôt heard shooting or all the Fortnite crazy sounds coming from their room. But Hey, maybe we will find out what Bluepoint has going on soon, or Insomniac‚Äôs known games like Spiderman or Wolverine since those guys at least get how to make superhero games, or maybe Ronin or one of the FF games coming up. I figure State of Decay will continue on like the monthly games on Plus, a once in a while shock you month.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/02/23/state-of-play-february-2023-all-trailers-and-complete-recap/

If it‚Äôs getting remastered, sign me up and take my money. As for the rest, well‚Ä¶about the new trailer for the game, Suicide Squad Kills The Justice League. We were all skeptical (and excited) for the game, Kevin Conroy‚Äôs final performance as Batman will be emotional and heartbreaking saying goodbye to one of the most beloved actor portraying The Dark Knight for 30 years.

CAPCOM is the worst at releasing EQUAL collectors editions around the world as well as BETTER VERSIONS being released to certain stores‚Ä¶. WE SEE YOUR SHADY ANTI-CONSUMER TACTICS releasing inferior versions to some of your biggest regions! THE USA NEVER GETS the LENTICULAR SLIP COVER versions of your games that you give to many stores around the world but screw over North America never sending it here! I bought the RE 2 & 3 remakes as well as Village collectors editions in the USA as well as Imported all the Japan Collectors editions to discover CACPCOM Japan went above and beyond making the packaging collector chest with raised textures, a well made lid which all extra fine details made it look like a real chest‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ THE USA collectors packaging for Resident Evil remakes did not have that extra love put into the design and could tell it was just a cardboard box taking way illusions that the Japan version gives! Why did Capcom even make two different boxes for their collectors Resident evil collectors editions; Amazing packaging for Japan, and the rest of the world got a crappy inferior box by far! THE WORLD SEES these shady tactics! What a  Bunch of BS to be SO SHADY with INFERIOR COLLECTOR PACKAGING to other regions! CAPCOM does this the WORST of any manufacturer, and are the most shady even more than Nintendo! Since you screw over the US every-time sending NO lenticular versions here for a chance to but I am forced to buy from a store over seas in the UK all my LENTICULAR versions. I had to Import Devil May Cry 5 LENTICULAR SLIP COVER version, Resident Evil 2  & 3 remakes with LENTICULAR SLIP COVERS, as well as RE VILLAGE with LENTICULAR SLIP COVER. But, for Resident Evil 4 Remake not yet released ShopTo are not offering any Resident Evil 4 Lenticular edition because they said CAPCOM chose not to give it to them as they gave it to other retailers this time. What a bad decision when CAPCOM clearly gave ShopTo all past Lenticular covers for all CAPCOM games; giving collectors a chance to continue their Lenticular collection consistently and now CAPCOM decided not to give ShopTO The Lenti cover for RE 4, WHY????? PLEASE FIRE THE ENTIRE MARKETING TEAM AT CAPCOM! They never CARE! Is it that hard to put yourself in the collector gamers shoes and realize you gave this retailer ShopTo  every other Lenticular version and should have clearly received this RE 4 Lenti version that other Unknown stores are selling i internationally. Also, neglecting the USA for some odd reason with these Lenticular versions is a horrible business decision! That Lenticular  RE 4 version should be able to be bought here in the USA as well, so you seriously suck CAPCOM for releasing certain BETTER versions unfairly around the world !!!!! THE WORLD FANS see CAPCOMS shady tactics with crappier packaged versions released in larger markets!  RELEASE THE BEST VERSIONS FAILRY AROUND THE WORLD! WHERE ARE THE LENTICULAR VERSIONS FOR NORTH AMERICA! FIRE THE PERSON THAT IS SELFISH and HIRE actual GAMERS that will make CAPCOM thrive better then they ever were! Keep ignoring fans, and this is why fans end up stealing a Companies products when they are continually ignored and doing things your own way; we‚Äôll just steal then! Your company can make more profits if you actually listen to the fans and stop being stubborn‚Ä¶. CAN JAPANESE COMPANIES PLEASE LISTEN AND RELEASE there packaging FAILRY! Stop being inconsiderate and stubborn! Thanks ALL STANDARD COPIES should be the LENTICULAR VERSION! Please Stop giving the International communities inferior packaging as well as not even giving better versions like the Lenticular covers to large countries and then making the best packaging for Japan is ridiculous! Maybe in the 90s when everyone wasn‚Äôt so connected to the Internet CAPCOM can pull off these SHADY TACTICS but  Now In Current times your fans all see what gets released in other countries. It is completely messed up that CAPCOM still does better packaging for Japan in current times when it just pisses off your collector fans! FIRE ALL THE BOOMERS!THEY are OUT OF TOUCH with current Gamers! Thanks",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/02/23/resident-evil-4-trailer-debuts-new-action-gameplay-announces-mercenaries-mode-demo/

Look what they did to their single player games, nickel and dime out the bat dlc, had loot boxes in shadow of moredollars and retconned it out after with the game worse for it. Look at the prior rocksteady game basically a different studio at this point. Knight has loads of dlc nonsense. It is easy to forget though with wb putting all the batman and mordor stuff on 75-85% off every week. They looked at the other pubs making bank on gas and mtx battlepasses etc and put the team on ip that could make that. So they could print money off this for years, ALL THE MONEY or it‚Äôs not enough, that gta5 momey, the destiny money. Nobody cares about suicide squad we wanted to play as the justice league not against them, and certainly not with bots. This thing is doa, and it‚Äôs a shame the arkham trilogy was and is excellent. They are so greedy and crass they won‚Äôt update the 3 games to 60fps on ps5 either, which is all we are really asking for. A leopard doesn‚Äôt change it‚Äôs spots. You need to give these companies the contempt and skepticism they have earned. No local coop, so no real friends, no sons with dads, brothers with brothers or any family combinations or couples that doesn‚Äôt involve 2 ps5s plus accounts etc smh. And I‚Äôm supposed to be excited for cosmetic bs polluting the screen? While playing character I dont care about shooting blue pus buttons. Yeah sure WB, take this game and its production value and put it with batmanless gotham knights because your greed blew it. Make what people actually want and we will pay you, simple. Im going to enjoy watching this game die just like Avengers. The fake out on Sefton Hill was priceless guy sold his shares and left, but they desperately want us to remember him and his part of the og trilogy, which we do.

Callisto on its own wasn‚Äôt good enough to make me a fan of that style of game, but DS Remake had me sold‚Ä¶ Callisto went from feeling like a chore to a total blast (though clearly nowhere near as good as DS).  I hope it sold really well because we need more games like it. It‚Äôs like a perfect cross between half-life and resident evil, 2 GOATS.

Unfortunately, that‚Äôs the world we live in. Let‚Äôs make the best of it. :)",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/27/7-trends-that-shaped-playstation-gaming-in-2022/

2419,ReelTawk,"December 31, 2022 at 1:40 pm PST",2022 gaming overhyped and undercooked. So many games were a disappointment this year. Elden ring and god of war kind of saved it imo.

2422,FeistFan,"January 12, 2023 at 2:04 pm PST","Trends like, releasing games unfinished and raising prices to ask gamers to pay a premium to be de facto beta-testers? I know neither the quality nor the pricing are trends that started in 2022, but they mentioned The Last of Us Part 1 in their ‚Äúfamily‚Äù category, and the plot of that game is from 2013. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, 2022 was a great year for PS5 games. But pushing the envelope on releasing unfinished games AND raising their prices wasn‚Äôt a high point.",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/27/7-trends-that-shaped-playstation-gaming-in-2022/

I love how medieval-inspired artwork games are having their moment right now :) The only suggestion I‚Äôd have is when you post a blog announcement for a game, that you also make a store page for the game so people can wishlist it right away and be notified when it‚Äôs available. It‚Äôs really easy to lose track of these great games when we don‚Äôt have a store page notification letting us know when it‚Äôs ready. Food for thought!",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/21/potion-craft-is-coming-to-playstation/
