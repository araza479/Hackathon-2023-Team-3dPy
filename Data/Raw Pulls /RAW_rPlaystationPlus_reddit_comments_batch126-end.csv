By all means add a subscription catalogue but why bother adding another on top?It's not like the people want want to play the classics can just pay for those either, they're stuck paying the highest amount."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16e7v7z/ps_plus_price_hike_stings_in_face_of_low_5/,KileyCW,4 mo. ago,"I have to be honest I've been gaming forever,  am the perfect target for the classics upper tier and it took me awhile to even figure out what we get at the top tier and even when I did the buy up for a few pennies one month I was disappointed with the offerings. I forget which classic I could only stream but it was the first game I tried and ran into an 8 minute queue."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16e7v7z/ps_plus_price_hike_stings_in_face_of_low_5/,AcadianViking,4 mo. ago,PS3 games cannot be played on the modern hardware architecture. To allow it to play the games are streamed from an emulator.But the whole fucking reason we pay a higher tier for the classics service is so we can have decent fucking servers and be able to stream without waiting in line. Also the offerings on classics is very slim pickings.

Usually you can find em there for dirt cheap. Parts aren’t hard to come by either if they need em. Usually a dead ps3 just needs a new squish of thermal paste and a good cleaning
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16e7v7z/ps_plus_price_hike_stings_in_face_of_low_5/,Rei1556,4 mo. ago,you sure about that? I'm pretty sure ps3 emulation has come a damn long way in terms of playability
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16e7v7z/ps_plus_price_hike_stings_in_face_of_low_5/,AcadianViking,4 mo. ago,"Thats just how the PS Classics work. They all say stream on PS3 games. You can't download them to your console. The emulator isn't built into the PS4 or PS5 consoles, so they can't be played natively."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16e7v7z/ps_plus_price_hike_stings_in_face_of_low_5/,Rei1556,4 mo. ago,sounds like a waste of money and better to just install the emulator on your gaming pc

Just got a ps3 and a copy of ico instead
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16e7v7z/ps_plus_price_hike_stings_in_face_of_low_5/,thetruemask,4 mo. ago,"Yeah PS Now (as it originally was called) / PS premium is a garbage service. They should have shut it down long ago. On top of being overpriced (yes even before hikes) the quality is horrible.You need a fast connection for one which not everyone has, even then you get like 720p blurry / grainy gameplay that doesn't even feel right playing it. I tried to play MGS4 because it was my favorite PS3 game and it was awful, low res, so blurry and some latency.Better off buying a used PS3."

I super dig remote play, but I couldn't imagine playing something serious via Sony streaming. Maybe like a turn based rpg but the queue was just weird. How many people could possibly be playing a 15 year old game to have that much demand?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16e7v7z/ps_plus_price_hike_stings_in_face_of_low_5/,mlemaire16,4 mo. ago,"This was similar to my experience. Got the deal on the upgrade so started playing some classic Ratchet and Clank. Worked okay, but found it grainy and the performance was lacking but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Gos forbid I left it paused for a bit to go the bathroom or something and then I get kicked off.Ended up just buying an old ps3 slim locally for like $50 and getting it on disc. I had quite a few ps3 games I grabbed over the years knowing I’d eventually find one again but didn’t get the itch.The streaming for ps3 games is shit, it’s unfortunately that simple. I’ve got a 1.5GBps service too, and anything besides the ps3 streaming is stellar. Very disappointed."

Same with Syphon Filter. Smells like they do it to cover they're asses in the long run because they can just push out two games a month from the franchises they're doing. Still no fucking Dino Crisis and I KNOW that was on the teaser poster.

The price hike is so damn steep that I immediately dropped it back to Essentjal and may even cancel altogether. This is a bad move that’s going to lose them even more subs.

It's been like 85% of the premium releases. And it baffles me that Extra gets an assload of games and they split up the premium to like 3-5 a month. Should've just dropped all of the Syphon Filter and Twisted Metal games at once instead of double dipping with half of them. So dumb.

Sony told us for years that adding trophies to games was way too much work and they retroactively added trophies to some of the PSP games in the last couple months.

This time next year if we’ve not seen an Improvement we need to all start voting without wallets and telling them no.

They said that after such a successful ps4, how will Sony shoot themself in the foot this time. As they messed up the ps3 then fixed it with the ps4 and now messing up with the ps5. If Xbox didn’t have there crap together PlayStation would be in real trouble. They’ve got two massive misses this year alone and now this. The vr launch was dreadful and was such a waste of money for Sony when they could have just put there games on a existing vr platform and struck a deal with one of them to work on ps5. The ps portable thing is the most pointless thing I’ve ever known. Everyone who owns a ps5 has a smart phone that can do more than that and not be 200 quid and this price hike for a service which is good to ok. What a weird company."

The new price has been bumped from $170 to $250, nearly 50% increase, with no added benefits. This is about $150 USD for what is essentially Extra with 10 PS1 games and 2h demo games.I've never played a single PS1 game that was offered because they weren't any good ones. I fell for the promise they might add actual true classics but ended up wasting my money instead.So it was never even worth it to begin with, and the price hike just establishes that even more.

I know they're on extra but I'm talking about essential right now. The only AC that was ever on PS+ was Freedom Cry, and that's a standalone DLC.Hitman 3 - since all 3 games have been merged into one big game, I highly doubt it'll ever come to PS+, I have never even seen this on sale either. No matter how often I look it never changes.Aragami - it's also on extra but I want it to be essential. It's such a good game and is also like never on sale. Last time it was, was in fucking january...The Order 1886 - I have no idea why it's not on there already. There's literally no reason to not do it. It's even a Sony title so cmon just do it.Uncharted The Lost Legacy - it's funny how we got Uncharted 1-4 throughout the years for essential, but Lost Legacy just doesn't want to be there at all. I already played it but it still baffles meGTA - I know 2 of them were on extra before, but there was never even one of them for essential. Not even the terrible definitive editionTLOU Part 2 (and probably Part 1 as well) - pt2 is already 3 years old, so why not give it to us? If it would be atleast on extra but not even there. I will honestly never understand how some FIRST PARTY titles are NOT in the game catalog. Take a look at xbox they have everything that's coming from them directly in the gamepass. That's how it should be. And yeah no way I'm gonna pay 80 bucks for pt1 lol, just put it on there already.Honestly since the new price increase there's no way I ever gonna get extra again, maybe for 1 month. That's why I want them to be on essential. Also I hate when games suddenly get taken off."

It could all be for show, but they’ve show a willingness to work with other companies with COD, just as they’ve done with Minecraft, fallout 76, elder scrolls online…etc. Those games were never taken away from the services they’ve been on.Now they know Sony will never go for COD on plus day one. There is no benefit for them. They make a crap load of money from the $70 purchase of COD and I’d bet 90 percent of the people whom buy it are already subbed to ps plus in some form, so the sub bump will be minimal unless it is a conversion from essential or extra to premium. So without the 30 percent cut of the $70 boxed sale of COD that leaves only Micro transaction to profit from. This is why Sony is throwing a fit. Then if it hits gamepass day one (ms can absorb that hit) it basically becomes an exclusive for ms without being an exclusive."

I'm confused what the free games would have to do with the value of extra. Let's see what happens in their reports over the next year. I don't think it's fair to say if it worked or not based on general observations of people. I doubt that many people even noticed the price change outside of the internet. I think they give great service. I've been disappointed with the games before, but they're free? Idk. I've never been subscribed to PS Plus for the free games, it's always the discounts, the cloud saves, and the online play. When PS Now was alive I was subscribed to it and thought it was an incredible value. I can't imagine the free games being the reason majority of people are subscribed to PS Plus. It's unreasonable for people to expect price hikes to reflect service changes when that's not how businesses work. Businesses are not social services and IDK why we're treating PlayStation like they have some sort of obligation to us? You don't have an obligation to pay them their asking price, they don't have an obligation to give you a good value. Like what?"

Puts everything into perspective better (for me at least). So it's roughly 100 bucks for premium, vs 40 bucks(?) for the cheapest one.

You can only buy Plus subscriptions from PSN directly now right? No more Amazon digital codes and sales there. I always got mine for $40-45 off Amazon and last year got one from CDKeys.So I guess I'm late to the party but all that's gone now? Only sales though Sony directly?

But the thing is, when I go to my Subcriptions Management it shows: ""Next Payment: 60E 06/10/2023"". And when I went to see my last ps plus payment it was 60 euros as well.Am I having luck with some sort of glitch or what?I don't know what to do because if I go and buy the PS plus for 12 months with the discount, it says. ""Today you pay 90 euros and then after 06/10/2024 you pay 120E"" Doesn't that mean that by buying this, it would kind of overwrite my 60 euro payment, and then start paying 120 in 2024?

You do realize that music artists have the same issue with streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify whereas they get paid when their song is played and it's very little pay per play. Spotify offers a freemium which makes it even worse for the the artists. But times have changed and the artists have no other choice but to make money from concert tours.""If the game companies aren't getting paid enough by Microsoft to put their games onto Gamepass, then those game companies are better off not taking the deal from Microsoft and just releasing their game independently.""From a consumer standpoint that's easier said than done. The same was said about music artists. If they can't handle the subscription model then don't put your music on Apple Music or Spotify. They haven't backed out. It's the easiest way to get their music promoted and played but it's a huge loss in money.But since you did say that it's true that developers haven't bothered with Xbox because they don't want their games on GP after working years on them and spending millions to create them. Guess what they are doing? Going to Sony and that's why the PS5 has the best and more AAA titles.""You are lining the pockets of the Sony execs and they are probably laughing at you for doing so.""Perhaps you shouldn't be gaming at all if that's your attitude. People do have to make a living and you're making it sound shameful. How would you like it if people or your job felt you're not worth your income? Sheesh.""For me, knowing that Sony is making such huge profits, much of it from Playstation..""This is where you're 100% wrong. Neither Microsoft or Sony make money from their consoles. They are sold at a loss. You honestly think the power and performance of the PS5, coupled with a proprietary OS with a custom Home Screen, custom design and included controller and an included game is profitable for Sony at $399 USD? You couldn't build a PC matching any of that for that price.""And if they don't, I hope Microsoft keeps up the pressure on Sony, because I want better value out of PS Plus.""LOL.

Game Pass has a lot of EA support (especially the sports titles), Persona 3-5, and some healthy recent multiplat releases like A Plague Tale 2, Sniper Elite 5, Atomic Heart.PS Plus is utterly disappointing in terms of the Premium/Classics on offer and Game Pass obviously has that beat in terms of the old Halo games, Gears 1-5, Viva Pinata and so on.As an owner of both consoles it's not like either service is bad, infact both are killing it. But to me PS Plus feels just that tiny bit more essential right now with the strength of the console exclusives.

Based on the information here, the exclusivity Microsoft is looking for is only in the subscription based arena. Meaning it is released day 1 on game pass and can't be on PS+ (at least for a certain amount of time- this is unclear) however it could still be sold on playstation day 1. Some don't seem to know the difference between private game developers vs Microsoft/Sony development teams. Owned developer games like Starfield or Horizon: Forbidden West can be exclusive if Microsoft/Sony choose whereas a game like Cult of the Lamb which was developed by Massive Monster, an independent developer, can release on anything OR be convinced to enter into an exclusivity deal if they so choose.At least that's how I see it.

It helps Microsoft's PC side of gaming, but it doesn't nudge xbox sales any higher. I'd say the same for Sony too, but PS exclusives are actually consistently worth it w/ pretty quick sales/pricing reductions post release. We are taking about games/series like uncharted, last of us, horizon, final fantasy and all the other JRPGs, good of war, etc. And to top it off, they smartly time gate exclusivity to come out on steam at a later date most of the time. There's an incentive to get a PS console.Now for Xbox's big hitters you have.... Forza. Not kidding, that's it. Don't cope, Halo is dead, gears is dead, crackdown is dead. Now I know they bought out huge already established PUBLISHERS whose existing and new IPs might go the route of exclusivity. Not through Xbox though, through Game Pass. How many people are running out the door to buy an Xbox for Game Pass? My guess is not many, as more people are likely to go a PC route if they already own a PS5/PC. And let's be honest, Game Pass is not sustainable at its current price. The only thing keeping it a float is the absolute size of Microsoft, and even then it's very obv they are looking for a reason to drop Xbox entirely. Buys out 2 of the most massive and successful game publishers, and creates a subscription based on demand gaming platform that is available to PC.

But the trend am seeing in regards to this debate is that the behavior of both somehow cancels each other out. Bit literally nothing compares to the Activision purchase and Microsoft clear end game here. Microsoft is clearly going to netflix route.They went years without increasing the price of gamepass.

For PS4 and PS5 i dont mind to be standard edition. Since this way the studios can win twice by being paid for having their games on PS Plus and still sell DLC. What bothers me is there no opinion to play or buy the DLC even if i wanted.

Aiming in more chaotic situations takes a little getting used to. Most of the complaints about the game as it is today are head scratching to me.

As a co op game with a new map to explore and new toys to fuck around with where you’re making some of your own fun, it’s great.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1189ksx/horizon_forbidden_west_settings_to_consider/,BJgobbleDix,10 mo. ago,I would strongly suggest Gyro Aim (Motion Control) for aiming as well.  This game was meant for it.  Turn the sensitivity up a bit too as most games have it low by default--may even have it near max for Horizon or TLOU2.  It gives PC mouse-like aim for controller players and makes ranged combat much more intuitive once you get use to it.  Thus making combat feel a lot more fluid and even faster paced.  I use it in any game that has it like MW2 and Fortnite as well.It also frees your right thumb up a bit more so its easier to perform actions such as rolling or jumping without losing your aim.  The right stick only recenters the screen.  Here is a handcam from MW2 to show how it kinda works:https://youtu.be/zsPyyPdtiAIHeres a list of other PS4/5 games with it in case youre curious:https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/svbqnd/updated_playstation_list_of_games_with_gyro_aim/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

Like things are happening and it's great if you help them along. Though it doesn't feel like the world is tied to you or needs you to make it progress. To me it was like you can help the world you are in but are not the chosen hero of it.

The game isn’t anything special at all but it is a title that has been out since the early PS4 era, and has never been offered for free once, as opposed to GoW which has been offered for free multiple times.

Instead, it turns out to be a mess - its like during mid development, someone in management said:guys we need to release the game soon so we're going to make do with whatever we can.When you start the game, you will think, hey this is pretty good, but the longer you play, you will slowly realize that is a massive flop. The game feels like an alpha, the level designs are uninspired, the weapon leveling makes little sense, the enemies were recycled over and over again. The number one flaw is how the combat works, because in all zombie/monster games, you need to put some distance between you and monsters. But in this game it is completely the opposite: Jacob is an absolute god when monsters come near him. So what will be the tension/sense of danger for the player?Absolutely none.I wouldn't recommend buying the DLC if you want to get to the ending. Just watch it on youtube.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17w5gi4/value_of_novembre_2023_ps_plus_extra_games/,Milli_Rabbit,1 mo. ago,"Its not a failure to you but to Microsoft it is. I agree with you that it is amazing, but it isn't working out financially. They are now trying to keep padding it with new games hoping they can drastically increase subscribers. The problem is releasing new games on a subscription service immediately. It destroys the studio's revenue from release day sales. Essentially, XBox is cannabalizing its own profits. The solution is what Sony is doing. You release games that otherwise wouldn't get much attention (indies usually). If they blow up, you have a great IP in the making. This also helps the indie studio because they get paid a lot to put their game on there. For AAA games and exclusives, you release them on the subscription service much later than initial release in order to not cannabalize your profits. Why would you not want to do that? Because you will end up rushing games and cutting budgets which leads to crappy exclusives like with Microsoft's games. AAA studios not owned by Microsoft are struggling to succeed as well due to their model but feel they must participate. They also cannot afford to create new IPs due to low tolerance for risk.Here's a video if you are interested but it is so damn long...https://www.youtube.com/live/suv8lZxEE_M?si=WiPczSLB8Q7ef43w"

Most gamers won't wait a year to play a game they want to play. Spider-man 2 for instance wasn't a day one. Probably won't see it for atleast a year on ps plus, but it sold 10 mil copies. Day one releases on game pass, and the fact the Game pass has no console exclusives, everything on console game pass can be played on PC game pass, there's really no point in owning an Xbox.Now while I agree that Game pass is awesome, I knew the Day One Exclusives were gonna be a financial disaster for them, and figured it'd either change or the price would be raised drastically.

I m quite sure they even paid LESS then the discounted price so forget about the value. Then look at the games again. I played Dragons Dogma early on with my PS4 and even then it was on sale sure it's a hidden gem but it's stone age old. After those games I downgraded from plus to essential it s absolutely not worse paying for anymore. Imran I got Dragon Man with no name , Wild Hearts, F1 Simulator, Football Manager 2023, Dungeons4 only to name the latest, fir my Xbox x in gamepads which COST ME LESS then playstation plus. The value there is far more greater and Sony may lead in consoles Sales but they sure loose bug time on the monthly subscription service and if I weren't afraid of loosing all my PS4 games from playstation plus I would have long cancelled the shit already. Giving money to charity instead if Sony would be far better."

Can't wait for Ishin. Always wanted to play it but it was never localized until now. Gonna spend some quality time with it. Also if you're interested in the series and never played any of the others definitely check out 0 and Kiwami 1 and 2. If you really enjoy them then get the remastered collection and 6. Also Judgement and Lost Judgement are both really great games. I like Judgement more but Lost judgement is still a very fun experience. This series has become one of my all time favs and I only started playing with 0 like 3 years ago and got hooked enough to play the rest.

I figured a lot of people already had the game and being on ps plus probably didn't really help it that much. I think Like a Dragon's popularity was immensely helped by being put on ps plus. As for Mass Effect having it on ps plus gave people who never played the series a chance to enjoy one of the classic game trilogies, and for veterans a chance to hop back into Shepherd and maybe play the game a way you never did before. Me personally I got to play as paragon Shep for the first time. Then I decided to run through as renegade femshep. It's a little more satisfying punching that reporter as FemShep. catfight!"

The removal will be because that contract has ended and either party haven't negotiated a renewal.Could be a host of reasons from wanting more money/having agreements with other subscriptions/only wanting on for limited time to promote a sequel etcI just wish they stated up front exactly how long it was going to be on but seeing as no subservices in similar vein do I'm guessing there is contractual/business reasons to not.

This is the first time I experienced this. Weird thing is, that I’ve downloaded, played and deleted other AC games from PS Extra and it gives me the option to buy whatever version I want. Checked a load of other games I’ve downloaded that are still on Extra and in my library all of them give me the option to buy whatever version I like. Left 4 blood is a perfect example: i can either download standard edition it as it’s still on PS Extra, buy standard edition, buy Deluxe edition or buy Ultimate edition. It’s very frustrating, as we shouldn’t have to contact customer services or even cancel subscription. Xbox does this so much better!!"

Usually, what this means is that if you plan to buy the dlc, you have to get the original game first, (or a bundle with the dlc in it), instead of just buying the dlc directly off of the ps plus version of the game.Again, this usually happens for specific games, it is not the norm. You may very likely be able to purchase dlc for this one directly if you own the ps plus version, I am not 100% sure."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16cgzyp/so_i_guess_they_removed_the_pricecap_on/,Piratefox7,4 mo. ago,Yes but Xbox has better backwards compatibility. Ps needs to bring back the best selling generation in the PS2. It should cost nothing to get the old games on the system. The games are small so add a bunch of those to justify the price hike. People would accept that. If you add a lot more to the service people will pay right now it feels like we are getting nothing extra and asked to pay more during a recession.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16cgzyp/so_i_guess_they_removed_the_pricecap_on/,Piratefox7,4 mo. ago,Spiderman 2 is a ridiculous ask but when you are charging what you are charging then you look at your competition who does day 1 AAA games then yes it looks bad. If there are new customers out there then they might choose Xbox or PC game pass. GPU price is down so it's cheap to buy a good GPU and get into PC games. Then games eventually come to PC anyways so true exclusive is going down. Microsoft can afford to hold their games back forever. They should be trying to keep their customers happy since they have the sold more consoles. There is a reason they are afraid now that Xbox bought Activision.

Tho im not celebrating spending $59.99 when my original plan was to do what I do every year and get a year’s worth of PSPlus for 40% during black holiday sales. But I’d rather spend $59.99 than $79.99. Shit is insane. I definitely don’t get my moneys worth even when it’s 40% off the old price.This is the first time since Xbox has been around that I’ve contemplated ditching PS. At least with Gamepass you can 100% justify spending money on a monthly service. PlayStation Plus is absolute garbage.This is mind blowing because I’ve been under the impression that the tiered PS Plus has been a disaster (not in regards to membership numbers but just public perception of the service and it’s bang for players’ bucks). That Sony thinks they justify a price increase is so bizarre to me. I can’t understand what they are thinking. You’re just pricing out a large segment of your user base. $159.99 for a year? Who the hell can justify that? Even if money isn’t an issue for someone it’s hard to justify spending that money on what is a subpar service.

I think that's just because of the scope of the game, there's so much to do and different avenues of adventure to pursue. You can be a planetary explorer, mine for resources to research new technologies for weapons and spacesuits; become a bounty hunter, either hunting other spacecraft or bounties on foot; upgrade your ship and put skill points into becoming a proficient pilot, able to fly bigger and better classes of ships; you can be a mercenary and do missions for the many people who need help, gaining better loot and credits; you can join factions and complete their questlines, accessing unique spaceships, armour and weapons.And there's so much more, before you even get to the main questline. I'm not saying it's for everyone, because there are people who won't like the lack of direction and the broad scope. The direction is there if you want it though. My advice is to pick the thing to do that interests you most and have at it. It really falls into place once you do that - for me that was exploring, looting and getting better spacecraft.I will say, when I first landed at New Atlantis, where the world opens up, I thought the game was a bit of a turd and got very disheartened.

The current ones aren't even really better than what we've had with FIFA 12. The games have already developed into a bigger cash grab than games like Genshin Impact. Imagine that, a literal gacha game and one of the most successful and profitable at that, has a fairer monetization method than FIFA Ultimate Team.I used to play religiously, my FUT 12 team was ridiculous and I'll still occasionally enjoy a game casually. But the game is just dogshit. There's so much wrong with it. From game modes that have been neglected for a decade, to the cash grab that is FUT, to the gameplay being incredibly boring (just ask anyone who plays the meta) and all the other tiny things that just suck. Like the dogshit AI, to the slow cutscenes they put back in the new FIFA and worst of all, the games don't improve on themselves, they just change every year what new move will be OP. From L1 + triangle, to R1 + circle, to crosses from the wing. There's always some bullshit way to score cheap goals.It's popular, but it's certainly not good."

Only exceptions right now are Ratchet & Clank, Spider-Man and (currently playing) Fenyx Rising.Writing out the following a bit for my own record as well: Games played from PS+Essential: Spongebob, Persona 5, God of WarExtra: Guardians of the Galaxy, Little big Workshop, StrayPurchased: Ratchet & Clank, Horizon Forbidden West, Spider-Man: Miles MoralesNot a big list for each section.

Maybe you didn't claim the game or it was a PS Extra/Premium game.Never have I had to download a game that is PS Essential. I aleays just claim them and they are on my library. Stop spreading misinformation."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1015ys8/reminder_last_chance_to_claim_ps_plus_december/,SkeeterDxx,1 yr. ago,Yes as long as it's part of ps essential or any tier and you just have them in your library it's fine they will always be there. It's when they take the game off ps essential and all tiers. When you can no longer find the game on the service that's when if you have not downloaded the game it will still be in your library but with a lock symbol in the top right corner. The game literally has to be pulled from the service.

It's when they're not part of that anymore is when it occurs.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1015ys8/reminder_last_chance_to_claim_ps_plus_december/,A_Davinus,1 yr. ago,So just downloading it once is enough? Also ive never noticed a game disappearing so they do it very rarely then?
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1015ys8/reminder_last_chance_to_claim_ps_plus_december/,SkeeterDxx,1 yr. ago,Ya just download it to console or any inter/external storage and your good.  I got a 4tb external with less then 1tb left cuz I have so many in my backlog.  It's really rare.. the only games I can see where I got locked out is mafia 1 2 3 and Ys: Lacrimosa of Dana
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1015ys8/reminder_last_chance_to_claim_ps_plus_december/,Luna259,1 yr. ago,Yup. Just make sure if it ever shows up on PlayStation Plus Extra/Premium that you don’t claim it again as the new licence will overwrite your current one meaning that when it leaves the service you’ll lose the version you have now. Support can fix that though
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1015ys8/reminder_last_chance_to_claim_ps_plus_december/,Raghuram_99,1 yr. ago,Yes read about this problem on this sub. Quick question: Will it override even if I claim a different version of the game? Like in claimed standard version via monthly games and I downloaded a directors cut via extra. What’s the scene then?
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1015ys8/reminder_last_chance_to_claim_ps_plus_december/,Luna259,1 yr. ago,I don’t know for that one.

My point is that you’re not exactly making good use of that time. 1-3 hours maybe justifiable.Something in your descriptions aren’t adding up and perhaps you’re in denial or just seeking attention. Either way, try to learn a new skill or pick up a hobby (investing, app design) that can be useful to you. You’re not gonna find any fulfillment from this a few years down the line, and may find deep regret if life doesn’t workout well for since you had the time to change things or create a buffer.Things in moderation are fine, but if this many people are asking you if you’re ok, you’re lying to yourself, or lying to us, or both."

Skyrim wasn't as long as people told me it would be.Hidden Gem I would say The Messenger or Rythm Sprout. The messenger is a pretty good 2d platformer and Rythm Sprout is a musical game with Guitarhero-like gameplay that psnprofiles.com says only 37 people own and that game is incredibly fun.I simply focused on games I already had access to because I was buying more  games than I had time to play, so I decided to actually play the ones I have access to, instead of buying more."

I platted both...Dirt, while fun for what it is, just doesn't feel 'complete' to me. Just bare-bones, empty, soulless. Fantastic visuals and good vehicle handling, but have you ever played a Dirt game before? And I'm not talking about the Rally or Colin McRae installments, just the mainline numbered Dirt games...Dirt 5 is acompletedeparture from the previous formula, which would have been ok if it resulted in a game that was anywhere near as feature-complete, polished, and just generallyfunas NFS Heat.Heat is the best NFS I've played since Most Wanted '05, with the some of the most extensive customization so far (both performance and visual), a large but dense open world for those epic cop chases, a way better soundtrack imo, and the list goes on as far as improvements upon Dirt 5 in particular. But hey, to each their own!"
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/10g0pon/curse_of_the_dead_gods_dirt_5_eliminated_vote/,dershmoo,11 mo. ago,That’s fair. Maybe I disliked Heat because I was expecting something more similar to the Underground games. The dialog and the edgy presentation really annoyed me and the open world felt unnecessary and boring. The tuning options are also a joke. I also hated the rubberbanding in cop chases. Don’t get me wrong it’s better then NFS 2015 or Payback but it’s still far from the original games. I have yet to play Unbound so I hope that’s a little better.I got the platinum for Dirt 4 actually and I agree that Dirt 5 is VERY different. I still think it’s better than Heat though.

You can still launch the game with zero updates and internet connection is not needed.There are exceptions to the rule though like spyro trilogy for example only having the first game really on disc.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/10l4psj/final_update_on_the_future_of_marvels_avengers/,grunendaumen,11 mo. ago,Spyro trilogy when it first released was like that. I think there was pushback or something and so later copies have all three games on disc. I was only going to buy it if it was all on disc and then I turned my network settings off while installing to verify it actually was as it said.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18f1epe/20_games_leaving_ps_plus_extra_soon/,ComprehensiveBar6439,19 days ago,"It's not a console war, bud. It's a comparison between two different subscription services by weighing the quality of the products they provide against the cost to the consumer in order to determine their respective value. While video games tend to be subjective, yes, that doesn't mean their market value is immeasurable - it very much is.  Your whole ""it's subjective"" argument would go out the window if Sony or Microsoft were releasing games like LOTR: Gollum or Kong: Skull Island every month, and you'd have no issue acknowledging quality, or value, then.As far as ""console sellers"" go, people that are interested in big name, console exclusivesoverwhelminglybuy them on release, which is exactly why Sony has said they'll never release new games on PS Plus. You can try to argue that getting a console exclusive once or twice a year- 12+months after it's initial release, when 80% of it's market already consumed it, and the rest could easily buy a copy used or on sale for $20 or less- is somehow a great value, but you can't expect that argument to to go very far when it's held up next to a rival service that regularly provides access to day one releases of both exclusivesandoutside publishers. Instant access to the newest games, which have consistently high ratings from both critics and consumers, like those few I mentioned in that short list, is a very strange service to argue against it's being of value. That's what everyone would like to see from PS Plus, if they were being honest."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18f1epe/20_games_leaving_ps_plus_extra_soon/,Meteorboy,19 days ago,"No they wouldn't want to see that from PS Plus, because if Sony was going to add their first-party games as day one games, the service would have to be $500 a year to make up for the loss of revenue. The 20% of consumers who still haven't played Spiderman or Miles Morales will still be more than the number of people buying any of the day one games you mentioned except for Starfield. Believe it.You're looking at the services like they're Netflix. Luckily, PS Plus isn't actually like that - and not recognizing that contribute to other platforms being less competitive. The Essential tier gives consumers 3 games every month to keep permanently. You can only play them while you have an active subscription, but they're tied to your account forever. In just one year, you will have accumulated dozens of games. Over a decade, literally hundreds. This is just the tier people sign up to play multiplayer online - you get all these free games to keep over time. So consumers that have amassed these digital libraries that are playable even after the games leave the service have a very strong incentive to continue with PlayStation as their next console. You don't keep a single game from Game Pass. High ratings from critics don't matter when most people haven't heard of these games until they come to Game Pass. Otherwise, HiFi Rush would be talked about as much as God of War."

I wasn't sure I'd like this one... it walks a fine line, and I'd played some other games that were ostensibly about the same premise that didn't work for me, like Recettear. I did like it, though. It's one I'd thought about buying to try many times but never pulled the trigger.Wytchwood. The mechanics in this one are a little irksome at times--you need to do the same crafting tasks repeatedly--but the story and art are engaging enough that I stuck with it and enjoyed it.Ones I didn't like, but expected I would:God of War.  Just not for me, I guess. Combat felt slow and clunky, and everything else even more so.Dead Cells. I really like side scrolling exploration games, but this isn't really that, because of the randomization. It's got the fighting of that style of game, but, well, just that over and over. I just got bored with it.I Am Dead. I thought I had read good things about this, but it's pretty one-note. You just have to click on absolutely everything. Really tedious when you're missing one thing and just have to go back through and click it all again to see what you've missed, and the story is unremarkable.Ones I didn't really expect to like, but was glad to get a chance to try:Final Fantasy XV. I had heard some admiration for the road trip vibe of this one, but...nah.Mighty No. 9. Man, what a trainwreck.Batman: Arkham Knight. I enjoyed the first two of these pretty well, but that was kind of in spite of the Batman rather than because of him. I felt like the Spiderman games actually worked a lot better. I got to the first big Batmobile section of this one and bailed.Windbound. This one is designed to look really promising in screen shots, and it's fun for about the first segment, provided you turn off the survival aspects. (Yes, I know that's a big part of the game, but it's not well done here.) Then it takes you to the second segment, where the crafting tree goes a little further, but also all your supplies basically go away and you have to start over from the start of the tech tree. Completely killed any interest I had in the game.Indivisible. Kind of a metroidvania game, but with a weird battle system that I guess is supposed to be like a cross between turn based and a fighting game? There are no real stakes to it, because you can always just bring your character back to life mid-battle, which is kind of good, because the battle system is...weird. And separating it from the exploration doesn't feel great. And the story is weird and has too many characters. I feel like they got about 70% of the way towards finding the fun in this game, but by then they'd already really polished the art and the voice acting and whatnot and didn't have the money to rework the mechanics, so they just had to push it out the door. Lots of ambition, but falls way short. Very interesting failure though."

Also, it could have different languages, etc, included in the download by default on PS5, whereas PS4 it could region based or optional download from within the game (I've seen that a lot more in games lately).Just throwing some guesses out there.Most PS5 games actually are around the same size or smaller than their PS4 counterparts due to compression and the way the PS5 can handle data."

You can go offline and get a couple of days of extra game time but that has a limit of 14 days. If the account you are playing on is the one that has the games, you dont need to have it set as primary on the ps4 you are using. However if you are playing games from another account on the ps4 the other account must have the console set as primary.Not sure I understand your WWE case as I dont know if its an extra tier or essential. If it was on extra you wont be able to play on either console. If it was on essential, two cases: You play on the account that claimed the game. In that case you can play on both consoles and not care which is primary. Or you dont play on the account that has the game. In that case you can only play it on the console where the account has set as primary console.If you downgrade you cant play higher tier games anymore.

Happened too with Spacer’s Choice edition for Outer Worlds. I never expected to see much of that because SO many games transfer saves. But if they are reworking a lot for the upgraded editions, from a technical viewpoint I can see why it might be a necessary evil. Also on the bright side, it really ended up probably giving me (and still is giving me) a chance to do it all again and encounter things I maybe never did on the next go around with Spacer’s Choice Edition vs original TOW.So probably can have the same or a similar experience with Dead Cells."

It’s just easier for Sony and devs to have these transfer features than eat into their profit margins on server costs. The almighty dollar causes all the major game companies to do some fairly shitty stuff, all in their own ways."

It’s the infrastructure and man hours of support, and then the costs of powering them 24/7.It’s not blow away numbers cost by any means, but devs just giving people the finger so that companies can save a modest amount of money. Something game companies do that honestly isn’t in their best interests. The dodgy tactics (with some exceptions, such as microtransactions as much as I hate them) probably cost them money, with people just getting fed up and exiting from consoles or gaming."

Seems to be the way most companies do business. As a consumer I'm not crazy about it. Some businesses you have to use a different email to get the new customer price. I'm a new owner and on the fence do I really need it and hearing everyone complain has got me thinking unless there's a good deal maybe not. Next step I have to research this paying with a gift card but if it's just 10% and I'm on limited time I might not bother.

Extra offers awesome value for people who haven’t played games in quite a few years. Take a look at the catalogue and see how many games you’re interested in, might be worth it to give it a go for at least 1 year.If you’re interested in playing online, you’re pretty much forced to get at least Essential unless you only play f2p games.Premium is a pretty easy skip unless cloud gaming is important for you or if you want to play older games"

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ixttm/did_not_expect_this_offer_ends_1218/,ValidSpider,15 days ago,"I fully expected this.They messed up big time this year by increasing the price AND preventing current subscribers from getting the Black Friday discounts, something which many have done for years previously and can't afford to do any other.Was so bad they stopped reporting their current subscribers (evidently they lost a lot) and it made the current subs ask themselves if they really need it, of which many realised they actually don't.As a subscription service you're better off flying under the radar, taking your monthly payments passively, almost make your subscribers forget they're still paying for it. Not bring it to their attention and make them question it's requirement as you're massively increasing the possibility of customers unsubscribing.Expect to see a lot of these deals popping up in the near future."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ixttm/did_not_expect_this_offer_ends_1218/,ShadowReplicant,15 days ago,"Sony is getting desperate with these discounts. It's pretty obvious they're losing millions of subscribers, thus the decision to stop reporting PS Plus numbers. With the absurd price increase they're probably still turning a profit though."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ixttm/did_not_expect_this_offer_ends_1218/,niftyifty,15 days ago,30% increase means they have to lose about 20% of their base before they start losing money. I doubt it's 20% but maybe
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ixttm/did_not_expect_this_offer_ends_1218/,ValidSpider,14 days ago,"It's a 20% increase here in the UK (£59.99 for 12 months of Essential, originally £49.99)So for every 1 subscriber they lose, they'd need 5 new subs, paying the increased price to make up for the lost one. Since these players would have probably subbed at the previous price without question. So they actually can't really afford to lose even 20% of their subs.With the sheer amount of players and friends I've seen cancelling their subs, I highly doubt long term they'll keep the price up. The issue is that they said it's justified however for the extra £10 we get no additional benefits to what we had before."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ixttm/did_not_expect_this_offer_ends_1218/,niftyifty,13 days ago,"What? Your math is a little wonky but your explanation is still mostly correct. Let’s stick with 20% and make the math easy. If it was $100 and they had 100 members their revenue is $10,000. If they raise prices $20% it’s now $12,000. They don’t need 5 new subs. They need a ratio. So they can lose 15% of their member base and retain a revenue stream of $10,200. They don’t need new they just need to retain enough to be ahead. At 16% they start to lose money but that’s only immediately. They will regain member base over time. Old grumpy members leave and new ones replace them.It’s definitely justified though. We can get in to that if you’d like, but there is no argument against justification; mathematically at least. We hadn’t seen an increase in almost 10 years.Personally I think they should have done 5% increases regularly instead of one lump sum. That’s really the only thing upsetting people. The value itself is still undeniable."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ixttm/did_not_expect_this_offer_ends_1218/,ValidSpider,13 days ago,"Nah let me explain, it's not as simple as you've said.They only increased the price by £10 but by doing so will lose a number of customers whowerepaying 5 times that. So they need 5 new subscribers (5x£10) paying the increased price to make up for every 1 sub that cancels (-£49.99), otherwise they may as well have left the price the same.So with your example, £10,000 is 200 subs at £50.They were pretty much guaranteed those subs at the previous price, so $10k was coming there way already.BUT they increased the price which has made a lot of subs cancel, realising they don't need/want it. So if they lose just 10% of 200 subs (20) that's 20x$50 ($1000), they would need an additional 100 new subs (100x$10) just to reach the original $10k again, which puts them in a difficult position especially since they aren't offering anything new to attract new subs.The main reason for the loss of subs is due to the price increase, which is why the maths is 5 new subs required for every 1 lost sub because they were always going to get the original $50 even if they didn't increase the price, since they were happy enough to pay the new increased price.Also bear in mind that is just to make the same original revenue and Sony's goal was actually to make additional profit so ultimately they'd ideally want a minimum of 10 new subs for each one lost.Also the justification is only for Sony not the consumers. They've managed for 10 years at that price so unless they're going to offer more it's not justified to the consumers. As you said they should have staggered and built it up."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ixttm/did_not_expect_this_offer_ends_1218/,niftyifty,13 days ago,"How would a stagger justify the price any differently? The justification is that they needed to raise to keep up with costs. How they do it doesn’t affect the justification.We can’t make any assumptions with sub guarantees or anything like that. They have annual attrition like any other membership model. The math is sound. They can lose about 15% of current member base and maintain revenue assuming no other factors. Each new membership is not worth only $10 it’s the full amount. 100 new subs x 60 is 6k minus the $1000 you mention they lose. In your scenario they are up 5k. When we say a loss of 15% that includes all scenarios. People who would have stayed, bought a higher tier, whatever. We simplify that down to a total membership base loss of 15% and maintain a flat year over year revenue stream based on a 20% price increase.They offer discounts annually so we don’t need to adding for that because they are proportional."

You have to actually be active and cancel it right now. It won't cancel right away because you still paid for the remainder.

Guessing if there will ever be another sale like in the past. But its the new world of AI. Sony dumped years of subscriber and customer data into a program, and it spit out the most profitable sale schedule, for who, and what %. Its the same basic program that pro sports leagues use to create the most profitable season schedule. Ever wonder why almost every game is relevant  to playoffs by the end of the season? Nothing is left to chance when it comes to profit and these tools are available. Any PS+ sub who cancels out of protest was predicted as an acceptable level of attrition. And sony knows how many will come back for what price. The only random variable is the used hard disk market.Sony will eliminate that as a factor by the disk-less only PS6."

My sub expires after the sale, so I can either let it happen and hope they do the same thing last year and extend the sale until late December or renew Premium which after doing some research might not be such a bad option.I saw a few screenshots on here showing the total amount w/discount for Extra is about $101 (from the original $134). With the discount to renew Premium, its around $10 more at about $112. Now that I've gotten a chance to think it about more, I'm starting to lean towards just pulling the trigger and grabbing another year of Premium than risk getting stuck with the $134 price tag for Extra - which I'm not willing to pay that much for.

I think that many stores sell ps plus vouchers at the same price as the psstore. The reason you cannot downgrade with the offer is because probably your subscription ends after the black friday deals end. So i thought that if i went on a local store to buy a psplus voucher at the discounted price a could use it after my subscription end and with this way i wont have to pay the full price. But what im concerned is the possibility of it declining the voucher i bought at the discounted price. Does anyone know if this is possible at all?

Nerd stuff, including gaming, used to be looked down on quite heavily as something for losers, while sports jocks were the ‘cool kids’. As they have an inferiority complex, they reject the ‘cool kids’ thing and that reaction becomes part of the culture over time. Especially I think the elitist attitude came from this rejection of the mainstream too. Nowadays it’s a lot better as gaming’s more mainstream, but you’ll occasionally still see that reaction.Not saying that’s every person that shares the sentiment, but as far as I can reason out that’s the reason the sentiment became so common for a while to look down on sports gamers specifically as being less of a ‘gamer’."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/13wyguw/ps_plus_half_year_line_up/,Newer_Acc,7 mo. ago,"I usually buy PS+ on sale for $40/year, so if there's one or two games in a year that I like, the service is worth it to me. So far, I've enjoyed the offering this year with five of the games capturing my attention:Axiom Verge 2: Fantastic single player experience similar to games like Hollow Knight (i.e., a 2D metroidvania style game). I didn't get the platinum yet, but I've already beat the game twice and will probably return for a third playthrough at some point to eventually get the platinum. It's a fairly short game with tons of stuff to explore.Tails of Iron: This game surprised me a lot. From the name alone, I expected to hate it, but watching the trailer had me curious, so I gave it a shot. You play as a rat killing frogs. The game's in 2D, which I really enjoy growing up in the NES/SNES era. Combat was difficult but super rewarding when you finally beat the different bosses. I played through and got the platinum for this one. I'm contemplating another playthrough on Bloody Whiskers difficulty for the final DLC trophy.Sackboy: Fun game from what I've played of it, though a bit too easy for my liking. I haven't played much of it, but this was the only PS+ game that my wife got into this year, so it's fun playing couch co-op together.Mafia: I'm generally not huge on narrative-driven games, but I've played maybe a third of the way through this one and have enjoyed what I've played so far. I have to be in the right mood to want to boot it up, but once I do, I'm usually glad I did.Battlefield 2042: This one surprised me too. I enjoyed the PS3 era Battlefield titles, but before playing 2042, my impression from everything I've seen on Reddit is that it would be a  terrible game. My understanding is that it was a terrible game at launch, but as time has passed, the developers have improved it a bunch. Personally, I found the game pretty enjoyable. When it comes to online shooters, I still prefer games like Apex over Battlefield, so I definitely won't spend the time necessary for the Battlefield platinum, but I've enjoyed the small amount of time that I've played.All together, that's five games from the service that I've enjoyed so far this year, two of which kept me hooked enough to earn the platinum or make significant progress to it, so I consider that a win.  The two games I enjoyed the most were Axiom Verge 2 and Tails of Iron, and without PS+, I would have never even heard of these titles.I also played both Oli Oli World and Descenders for an hour or two, but I couldn't get into them largely due to difficulty spikes toward the start of each game that I didn't bother overcoming. I haven't played any of the others yet, but I'd like to eventually try a few of them (Fallout 76 in particular)."

Others might rank Mafia higher, but I'm already done with the original whose bullet sponge enemies vs my own rather cardboard defense stat still give me flashbacks.Special shoutout to Code Vein which has been a wild ride this year - purchased on PS4 in January (as my first retail investment on the platform in years!), then promptly showing up on PS+... and then recently repurchased on Steam after I got a Deck.😆 On that note, it's still a highlight for the lineup as well - an animesque soulslike with a job system and optional AI companions (among the cast, not community summons)  from the creators of God Eater series is nothing to sneeze at."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17hzsv6/so_i_tried_gotham_knights_this_month/,Kellstong,2 mo. ago,"I don't know what Gotham Knights wanted to do. At the end of the day, new games that push the industry forward raise expectations. We all have a soft spot for Spider-Man 2 on the PS2 (those of us old enough to remember), but don't go back and play it now. It's bad, things have got better. It's important and it was revolutionary, it pushed things forward, and now Insomniac are doing the same. Others have done so in between too I get it, just phrasing the argument.Importantly, though, Ultimate Spider-Man was good. Ultimate Spider-Man felt like a game that wasn't trying to compete with Spider-Man 2, it was going in a different direction, it had new concepts and ideas that were successful. It still pushed things forward, it just did so in a different way. People of course compared it to Spider-Man 2, but honestly, sometimes favourably, and not necessarily because they thought one or the other was 'better' as a whole.All of that's only relevant because it's not really about the IP, I'm not saying 'don't make a game based on intellectual property X if it isn't as good as this other one was at doing Y and Z'. You can do ABC instead. The new features in Gotham Knights just fall flat, they're on the whole uninteresting, and a lot of the things it's doing (traversal, stealth, to name just a couple) are just worse than how those same things were done in Arkham. So what is Gotham Knights for? It's at best bang average. And big game releases are expensive these days, it's unacceptable really what people paid for it."

Since it was free, I figured I'd give it a shot.It's amazing. Seriously, people are expecting all games to top successors, and everything is comparing. I get it, but come on.If you're a DC fan, the plot is actually really cool, and the lore is unique in comparison to any other Batman game, purely based on the story beats and when it takes place. The dialogue is awesome. The night patrol system keeps things fresh, the world looks great.No, it isn't as good as arkham. And that's fine. It 100% isn't worth 60 bucks in my mind.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17hzsv6/so_i_tried_gotham_knights_this_month/,noirproxy1,2 mo. ago,I've really enjoyed it and put about 50 hours into it. You need to get the fast travel areas unlocked and unlock a few abilities to really get a kick out of the combat.The bosses are super fun but it depends on the hero you play as too. Robin and Batgirl are easily the best to play as while Nightwing is so so and Redhood just doesn't work.Don't define it based on Arkham though. Kind of an unfair take for something immensely different.

It has more to offer than you would think. I played exclusively has Bat girl and I haven’t even explored the three other characters. Once you get past the fact that it’s not supposed to be like Arkham games and once you get past the intro there is fun to be had here. The constant criticism towards its 30 locked fps is pretty unfair imo. My biggest issue with the game is the bat cycle does feel slow and lame to ride, and scanning the drones to unlock fast travel is pretty crappy game design.

I've seen this work in ""some"" comics, but it doesn't work here... The ""humour"" is also terrible Nightwing is pitched all wrong. Babs is lifeless and Tim is made a teenage mess that can't deal with loss (yet he's supposedly lost a lot from his life already at this point) Something extremely jarring for me was when you fall from a big height, the animation is awful and the exact same if you fall from a step and the fight mechanics.... they're just so boring, with no feel to it.

A friend and I both played through the game together, had the full coop experience, and were both left disappointed in the end."

It doesn't have half the things Spiderman 2 does, including rt, and still runs at half the framerate.The protagonists are kind of boring and lame.

Its certainly not the worst game I've ever played. Its looks amazing, and the 30fps is fine and I'm not counting it as an outright negative. Clearly a decision was made because of the limitations on the hardware. The gameplay just feels off and I feel traversal and fight mechanics could have been a hell of a lot more refined.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17hzsv6/so_i_tried_gotham_knights_this_month/,MonkeyPunx,2 mo. ago,"Okay, so here's a take: the game takes a while to get going. In like, a wierd manner. It def has pacing issues for the first few hours. But once it really opens up, like all options are available to you, and you get into the groove, it's a really enjoyable experience. It's fun.For one, if you're a huge Batman nut like myself, I don't think we've gotten such a detailed, complete representation of Gotham before. Which leads into: This game hasmassiveamounts of Batman lore crammed into it. It's mostly text, but it's so much fun discovering all the little details the devs left in for you to peruse. If you like reading, which I do, it's a very fun little Batman encyclopedia.As for the gameplay, I don't think you're supposed to stick with one hero. They all share the progress and EXP, so you're supposed to juggle between them and take on missions with all. And they are surprisingly different among themselves, while all being sort of their own version of the Arkham games Batman. Robin is entirely stealth-focused, Batgirl is a heavy brawler, Red Hood a ranged fighter with big heavy melee blows and Nightwing- Um, actually Nightwing is kinda the blandest of the bunch. But still fun to play as.It has some really good boss encounters, lots of personality in little moments between all of the characters, and plays like an Arkham game with all the walls blown down. It wasn't sold very well, in my opinion the marketing giving away so many of the story details was a very odd choice, and their wierd focus on their loot and customization options (which, unsurprisingly, are the worst parts of the game) made for a tepid reception to what is a very enjoyable Arkham spin-off.My recommendation is, stick with it for a few hours, cycle between all heroes during every night of patrol, just ignore the loot system by equipping whatever has the highest numbers on each sortie, and you'll get a very cool Batman universe experience. All the suits look cool as heck too, which is a plus."

You would think it would be using 4k backgrounds and such and that would make it larger in size. I get with slower HDDs they had to have some redundant data but that’s the game 3x over.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/10rlrc4/ps_plus_essential_games_february_2023_review/,reck1265,11 mo. ago,Olliolli world looks like a fun game. Loses me on online trophies though. Specially the fact they ask you to post number 1 on the daily score. That’s a tough ask considering the crazy amount of people online who do nothing but play online and live to post the highest scores.
