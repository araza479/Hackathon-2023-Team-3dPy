12,rhapsody ii ballad of the little princess,PC,RPG Fan,Critic,"It’s unfortunate that it took over twenty years for the West to experience Rhapsody II properly, as the game is incredibly fun, amusing, and full of both heart and charm. The characters are just as hilarious as they are heartfelt, the musical numbers make the game stand out amongst its peers, and the game is wildly creative in every aspect. Rhapsody II‘s short length ensures it’s a breezy experience and a perfect palette cleanser amidst the sea of RPGs set in miserable worlds. Rhapsody II is a vastly improved sequel on all fronts, and while it has a few minor blemishes, it’s easy to recommend to anyone looking for a unique experience.","Aug 24, 2023",80

75,loot river,PC,Hardcore Gamer,Critic,"To say Loot River is a game mechanically and visually enticing would be to downplay just what makes a game of this stature such a treat to repeatedly explore. Unusual a pitch it might’ve sounded, the eccentric implication that “Dark Souls meets Tetris” isn’t entirely unwarranted. In a game whose novel implementation of movement alone is one with a plentiful amount of offensive, defensive and tactical potential, let alone a mere tool for traversal that can be as equally costly as it is a helpful aid. Just like its technical niceties that add so much to the pixelated aesthetic, it’s what the game doesn’t reveal at the outset — and thus, that desire to figure out the true path to success — that is by far the most impressive thing about Loot River. One that not only justifies its quirky alternative to run-based progression, but through it transforms the game from that of a humble roguelite into one that, strangely enough, is just as much puzzle-platformer as it is grueling dungeon-crawler.","May 2, 2022",72

Add food and drink stalls anywhere you want. Change the themese and colors of everything so it matches the style you want to have and dont forget the coaster builder.
Build coasters that go everywhere and anywhere. I had coasters going through other coasters at times.

You have multiple amusments to play at. Once you accomplish enough goals you unlock another one.
Each amusment park has three zones with its own theme and there are a lot of fun.
From a wild west shootout style zone to a futuristic zone with flying cars whizing by your face.
The variety is great. I could spend an hour making a awesome track going all around my park for cars to race on and the make a roller coaster to go under and over it.
You can talk with your guest and befriend them or even help them find someone to hang out with. You can even play a love matching game and help two people meet.
I found myself spending hours talking with guests to get feedback about the park.
The coasters become more fun as the game goes on and so do the themes.
The fact that you can put up a awesome virtual reality shooting game up for your guests to play and then run inside and play it is something I always wanted.

From water rides, to steel coasters, to race tracks..Thrillville is an amusment park fans dream.

91,thrillville,PlayStation 2,TheHumbleGamer,User,"I have seen many people confuse Thrillville and Rollercoaster Tycoon over the years, and the first thing that must be made apparent in this review is that they are most certainly not the same.

While Rollercoaster Tycoon focuses specifically on a more complex building aspect of making a theme park, Thrillville offers a much more casual experience that pre-sets many things for you but still gives you more than enough freedom to experiment and play around with the tools the game provides. Think of it as a gateway game to Rollercoaster tycoon for children and those with little experience in the genre.

Thrillville presents you with a simple task - maintain existing themed rollercoaster parks and draw in the crowds to make lots of money. To achieve this task, you must build stalls, rides and rollercoasters to wow the guests and build up more money to buy bigger and better stuff down the line. You can walk around your parks to talk with guests and make friendships with them, which increases overall happiness of guests. You can also hire entertainers (to raise happiness), mechanics (to keep rides from breaking) and cleaners (to clear up rubbish and sick from guests).

Many of the games you place down in your parks are actual playable games that can become addictive if you're not careful. As for rollercoasters, there are various types but the game always limits how much you can do with them.  Though as a child, I never found that to be too much of a problem because there was still enough space to get almost any vision you had for a coaster built.

Thrillville also offers a plethora of missions for you to complete, with various categories spanning your guests to your games, you'll find beating these missions very rewarding and satisfying.

Overall I find Thrillville to be a rather unique game with a lot more to offer than meets the eye (if you're willing to give it a chance that is). I had a lot of fun with this game as a kid and even today I still find it enjoyable to play. This game really isn't as bad as some make it out to be.","May 3, 2017",8

Not the end of the world because the game isn't very long (100% completion, hard mode, first blind playthrough save file clocked at 4 hrs and 8 mins), but I can see some people finding it tedious despite the game's brevity.

The real draws here are the emotional storyline and beautiful pixel art, but it's worth noting that the bosses were fun despite the basic combat mechanics of the game. ""Bullet hell"" attacks were commonly utilized in boss battles, so make of that what you will.

Overall, a short, simple, beautiful game with an engaging storyline. Not the greatest game ever made by any means, but certainly an enjoyable one. I paid $10 for it and I think that's the sweet spot for value.","Dec 29, 2021",6.6

162,not for broadcast vr,PC,Road to VR,Critic,"There's no denying the underlying game is fantastic, as Not For Broadcast confronts you with moral quandaries as you slowly become a well-oiled cog in a dystopian propaganda machine. While the game's binary button pushing wasn't as VR-native as we would have liked, the base game translates extremely well to VR, feeling decidedly more at home on VR headsets than on flatscreen monitors.","Mar 20, 2023",85

166,cookie cutter,PlayStation 5,Digital Chumps,Critic,Cookie Cutter is hyper-violent translation of old-school Metroidvanias that gracefully does not allow itself to get bogged down with convoluted modern flourishes. Exploration tools drop the player into a satisfying progression loop that doesn’t rely on random elements and combat is not overtly punishing. But it’s Cookie Cutter‘s unique visual palette and uncompromising absurdity that truly leave a bloody impression before ever allowing itself to grow stale.,"Dec 14, 2023",77
167,cookie cutter,PlayStation 5,Hobby Consolas,Critic,"Cookie Cutter is not just another metroidvania. Like so many others, it manages to find its place with its own ideas and aesthetics, that doesn't ""hold back"" and lets its gore and hyperviolent touch flow, with a macabre and punk humor. Too bad that some aspects need a little polishing, because it is fun and manages to catch.","Dec 16, 2023",82
168,cookie cutter,PlayStation 5,archdlx,User,"Wonderful blend of action combat and classic Metroidvania. Beautiful animation, inspiring main character and so punk rock. Highly Recommended!","Dec 19, 2023",6.5

184,custom mech wars,PlayStation 5,PSX Brasil,Critic,"Custom Mech Wars is a fun game if you like creating and testing mechs and repeating this cycle over and over again. It is a title aimed at this niche of player and, in addition, it lacks important options such as publishing your mechs online or a greater variety of scenarios in the campaign. I hope D3Publisher continues with the idea, as it has the potential to be something special.","Dec 23, 2023",53

200,hammerwatch ii,PC,Gaming Nexus,Critic,"Hammerwatch II gets into the meat of its gameplay right away. I loved looking for better gear and never felt like I wasn’t progressing toward something the entire time I played. I also loved the freedom to do side-quests when I wanted, no longer beholden to the linear story of the first Hammerwatch. Is it hard? You better believe it, but with multiple difficulty settings to choose from, anyone who is interested in Hammerwatch II won’t have a problem getting into the game. With so many new RPG games this year, it’s easy to see how Hammerwatch II could go unnoticed. While it might not look different, I challange anyone who is into the genre to spend two hours playing and not want to play more. If the developer can fix a couple of minor issues, like group loot in multiplayer games, this will hopefully find some legs to go the distance I feel it can.","Aug 14, 2023",67
