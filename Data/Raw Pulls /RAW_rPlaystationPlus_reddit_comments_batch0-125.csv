In today's dollars, that's about $70.Had you purchased 20 years worth of PS+ back in 2010, then up until this announcement you would actually have been losing out on the deal for the last few years.Only now with this new announcement is it actually outpacing inflation for the first time.  But in 5 years it will be caught up.Furthermore... Had you actually invested that $1000 in the stock market in 2010 instead of 20 PS+ subscriptions, you'd have about $4000 right now.  Which, at $80/subscription, would buy you about 50 years.Long story short - stacking subscriptions is kind of fucking stupid.  The price just doesn't rise by much historically."

Also last 3 years inflation was higher due to covid, war and food price. Previous years were much lower. And economist are forecasting inflation to drop to 3.7% worldwide average by mid 2024.Lets not forget that when PS Plus was completely overhauled in 2022 with a new pricing structure which people were forced to get also. And now nearly a year later they are increasing the price by 40%. Who says they wont increase the price again in 2-3 years.Even if inflation is the highest ever recorded (which is around 8%) per year, PS plus price increase currently is ahead of inflation by 3-4 years. If PS Plus increases price in 2-3 years again (which I feel will be the trend for PS plus), Ps plus is still charging 3 times higher than an 8% inflation rate"

I have of course already seen the November and September dates.I'm saying that I currently pay £50 per year for premium despite the fact that everyone else who didn't buy multiple years in advance pays over £100. To help avoid confusion because you are an incredibly intelligent individual, the £100 that people currently have quoted will become 120. Given that 120 is the new price if you currently pay 100 then what is the new price if you currently pay 50?""It says in the post"". It doesn't. It says the new price if you pay the previous of 100 but I pay 50 so it's not necessarily the case that I will have the same jump."

They don't need to do this at all. They could've at least maintained existing subscribers' rate instead of charging more at auto-renewal too.Honestly unless this comes with way more higher quality games way more often then I don't see myself staying subbed.

I'm just gonna have to be happy with what I have.  It's not like we are able to stream movies or anything with Essential and they're gonna charge us like they are Paramount+ with commercials.  This is forcing a decision I probably should have made a very long time ago.The Playstation 5 is my last console.  And I really love seeing how technology advances in the gaming world.  I watched graphics improve from Pong to Cyberpunk 2077.  It's been a great ride.  But, I can't justify the cost anymore.  Games are sold in beta states,  rewards that use to be a part of the base game are now microtransactions,  base game content is carved out to be sold as DLC,  and more.  Gaming use to be about everyone.  Now, all the suits care about is attracting whales -- players with extremely deep pockets.  Just remember, Playstation Plus use to be an all inclusive service that costed $49.99.  Now, for less service on the Essential package, they want you to pay $79.99.  It's just too much."

I'm usually not very hyped about base versions of games, since I feel like they're cutting off a part of their story to sell it as a dlc that you're probably not gonna buy because you're not into those kinds of games in the first place, so you don't really get the full experience. But it's cool knowing that the dlc offers nothing new to the table, and could be arguably better not owning it, considering you're basically removing padding."

Anor Londo is my third favourite after Sen's Fortress, and Shrine of Storms, but I use the term 'inspired' very loosely.It's basically just a  very minimalistic take on the architecture. But I found it to be a bit of an over-complicated, relatively empty mess, with basic copy paste textures, and assets throughout.I don't want to shit on Code Vein at all really, because I did enjoy it a lot . . .right up until I didnt. 😅 But i also dont want to be hyping it for Soulslike fans too much. Like I said, the combat is really good. But the level design is pretty piss poor. That will be fine with some people, and it was with me for a while.

On the chapters when you have to search for Haruka around town as she runs every time she sees you, was hell dealing with all those fights in between. I think I still have to find her again in Chapter 11 or one of the other kids who ran away, but I just can’t bother with chasing down kids in between random battles on the street not awarding even a level or smidge of XP to level up stats. At least after a while give me an idea of where they are on the streets with a line of dialogue instead of me needing to look it up just to save my sanity from those fights.The story also is just a drag. Any time it starts picking up on actual Yakuza matters they rip you out of it and put it back to the orphanage. That’s fine and that’s who Kiryu is now for story purposes, but in 11 chapters I think I’ve learned 3 or 4 actual pieces of info relating to the land development / orphanage, and some of the info is thrown at you like it’s a revelation when it seemed kind of obvious. I just hope the writing goes back up in 4, 5, and 6 since I wanted to play LAD with all the games knowledge."

I also like the characters in 3 a good amount.I think the kid stuff is fine, but it becomes tedious in comparison to the other games because of the gameplay compared to the remade version.

It's all about your own skills.I assume you're mostly using square + triangle combos since you called it repetitive.It's understandable cause a lot of players just spam this basic combo even tho they constantly buy new abilities.Check your unlocked abilities at the start of each battle, test them a few times and eventually it will click.Also, your damage comes from your heavy attack (triangle). The light attack is just a set up for you to decide which type of heavy attack you want to use. So don't assume that you should aways press 4 square and 1 triangle.For example, brawler style with 1 square + 1 triangle is great for when you want to deal some good damage rapidly.Lastly, don't use any pictures or books as gear, those make enemies more aggressive."

Not to mention people playing all the titles in the game passes over a game like 2k driveAlso there’s the Iol just wait until it’s on the game pass mentality with these mediocre games.  It’s just not worth the $$ and we’re gonna see this happen a lot.  Especially as these studios have a quick lever for cash to pull as ok the game disappointed let’s just cash it out to the game passes rather than slowly discount it etc which was the old strategy"
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18s4msv/playstation_plus_monthly_games_for_january_a/,djml9,3 days ago,True. GamePass and the like have successfully devalued games that arent the best of the best. Somethin AA like this doesnt really stand a chance unless it basically blows people away a la Baldur’s Gate 3.

It's combat is really close to GoW 2018 but with more variety and imo more satisfying. The story is dumb but in fun video game way. The graphics may not blow your mind but i really liked the art direction. So despite not having the best resolution and stuff the environments are unique and memorable.Objectively it's probably a 7/10, if it hits at the right moment like for me it's an 8,5/10."

Paragon would let you be diplomatic, while Renegade might have you punch the guy to intimidate them.P and R don't effect gear, abilities, recruiting, or any sort of non-RP elements of the game.

The HD re releases didn’t do a lot except for mass effect and although 2 and 3 were great they started to show their age.God of war won game of the year and countless other awards. It’s better received by critics and fans according to open critic.Objectively god of war a better game if you prefer mass effect that’s fine it’s horses for courses.I agree I can’t think of any trilogies that compete especially on ps4. Maybe the ps2 gta games or for me final fantasy 7,8,9 but they aren’t proper trilogies.I agree last of us 2 was better, couldn’t get in with bloodborne though.

I hate fanboys it’s easy to discount reviews giving games zero I have been gaming for 30 years and there is probably no game that I’d give a zero.I did try with bloodborne killed a couple of bosses but it didn’t click. Loved Elden ring because I could grind if I was struggling. I respect the people who love from soft games but they aren’t for me I don’t mind hard games I love cup head, super meaty boy and Celeste but that’s probably because you could get back into the action quite quickly but the long run to the bosses in bloodborne annoyed me more than anything else.

God of war also won loads of awards including best narrative.The mass effect  story does have epic parts talis for me was amazing and some of the choices are really difficult. God of wars story of a father reconnecting with his son, learning what it means to be human and arteus coming to terms with his god hood is also excellent.I have played through them both and have the platinum for the legendary addition and I prefer god of wars narrative but mass effects game play.As I said though critics found god of war better it won more wards than me trilogy so even though I may like mass effect more god of war is a better game."

Mass effect has sold over 14 million copies across 3 games with andromeda selling a further 2.5 million units according to Wikipedia (shit source I know) so I’d say it’s legacy is pretty much established. This doesn’t include sales of the legendary addition which would increase the series overall total.I am not saying it’s a bad game it’s one of my favourite series, it’s kind of like this I love lord of the rings with fellowship being my favourite but is that a better movie than return if the king?

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/103de8s/how_to_check_and_change_your_ps5_to_5ghz_wifi/,ManchesterFellow,1 yr. ago,Mostly correct. Also there is less interference normally on 5ghz. Most household appliances (including microwaves) give off a 2.4ghz frequency.Couple of things I learned as a technician too - apple devices love 5ghz. Don't under-estimate how much less 5ghz travels than 2.4ghz through stuff like walls and even cupboard doors etc.Spliiting the SSID on your router (which is what we are doing here) should only really be done if you are confident you can put it back

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/103de8s/how_to_check_and_change_your_ps5_to_5ghz_wifi/,Hey_look_new,1 yr. ago,it absolutely depends on how old the coax is in the house

My house is about twenty years old and it worked swimmingly.  Interestingly I later figured out that there was also Cat 5e in select sections of the house that had been used for telephone so I ended up using that instead.  But when I was using MoCA with my fiber connection I was really impressed by the speeds.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/103de8s/how_to_check_and_change_your_ps5_to_5ghz_wifi/,Null,1 yr. ago,It actually depends more on the number of splits and length of cable when using a MoCA adapter.Many isp companies are still able to offer 1 gig speeds with homes wired with older rg59 coax
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/103de8s/how_to_check_and_change_your_ps5_to_5ghz_wifi/,Eruannster,1 yr. ago,"Definitely. And if you do powerline ethernet (which can also be a good alternative) the wiring can vary greatly. In my house, going upstairs -> upstairs works great, but if I go upstairs -> downstairs, the speeds drop from 100+ Mbps to like 1 Mbps which was a bit of a downer since my game lounge is downstairs..."

Maybe I'm wrong, but the biggest gripe seems to be that it doesn't do anything particularly well while it has quite some issues... In other words your time is probably better spent on another game.After hearing the negative reviews on launch and seeing some gameplay I decided it's not a game I'm really interested in. Maybe there are enough redeeming qualities you have to discover for yourself or the new DLC packs change up the game, but for me the clear issues with the game were enough to not buy it.With it releasing on PS+ you can check it out for yourself. There seems to be some people enjoying it at least, so it's a good way to try it out if you want to. Probably if you enjoyed prior Saint's Row titles some stuff will click with you."

I don’t think Sony offers anything similar (officially) but imo it can’t hurt to ask if you buy a game an then within a few days or a week the price drops just give support a call and ask. All they gonna say is no as a worst case scenario.I do prefer to get my games on disc tho usually but il buy digital if it’s cheap enough. Got lou2 for i think 8 quid not long ago probably in the same sale. I tend to only buy digital games if they are really really heavily discounted.Jus got children of morta complete edition for less than a fiver couple days ago. Bargain at 80% off.

Don’t get me wrong, I think the game’s amazing. It just trips me up a little because I waited so long to get the game bc I was waiting for sale. But right after that, the next sale it was even cheaper, I could have waited a bit longer since at that time I was gonna add it to my backlog anyway lol. Btw my console is not the disc version, so all my games are digital.As for the price, I don’t know how much in £ tbh, but I think it was 50% off when I got it"

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/161tdkp/something_big_is_coming_to_essential_can_anyone/,deuceswld,4 mo. ago,"I never said buying at full price.  I said it goes on sale 60% or more off what you originally paid for it.I can't remember the game for sure, but it was on sale for a while at 25%.  Well, toward the end of the sale, I went ahead and got it and played it for, I think, a couple weeks. It wasn't very long.When the new sale on PS hit. The same damn game went on sale for 85%. Motherfucker. You suck discount algorithm.Anyway, on your point about buying full price. Yea, I normally don't buy games at full price unless I REALLY wanna play it, and in those cases, I have it pre-ordered.  Otherwise, I can wait for it to go on sale."

No reason not to just buy it especially if you have already played for free and know you enjoy it.If you go for the platinum in this (or even if you don’t)- you can expect to sink many fun filled hours into it, total engagement, bettering yourself running again etc - the value is immense, especially now."

Known as PlayStation Plus, the system provides access to exclusive content, complementary games, regular store discounts, andearly accessto forthcoming games.Many people have complained how game trials are only available in Premium tier. So either they'll shift that back to Essential or offer something like a 5 or 10 hour early access trial for upcomingPlaystation Studiosgames.They did anearly accesslast month for select users with the Gran Turismo movie.Another theory - Monthly games will include one classic PS1/PSP game like they used to at launch (PS1, PS3, PSP).

But I recently played Jedi Survivor on Grandmaster and some of the bonus fights (2 in particular) were so frustrating that Bloodborne is 100% more relaxing. Ended up having to turn down the difficulty, and was shocked when they didn't all sync unblockables.My first playthrough of Bloodborne wasn't relaxing at all, ended up quitting for like 4 years... But by now I've beaten it 4 times (one per each main damage attribute), every time on ng, every time doing all the chalice dungeons so I'm 100% a masochist.By now I know the game enough that there's not really much exploration of the areas (something that usually gives me anxiety if there are too many branches) and I know the movesets well enough that I don't really struggle much anymore, so it is relaxing :DWhat will never be relaxing is Dark Souls 3 because of the Ashes of Ariandel DLC, and late game Elden Ring.

It used to be that every CoD that came out was a big “event game”. People would get hyped for every release and each game would try to develop its own identity that was separate from the others, especially the other sub-series within the wider franchise. For the past few years, CoD has been moving heavily towards being less of a trueseriesand more of a single continuous game with a yearly subscription for the next big chapter of content. The huge moneymaker of Warzone is free to play and integrates content from each main game release, the games openly reference each other and include content from one another (Cold War had MW characters in it, for instance), and CoD even recently switched to a single launcher called “Call of Duty” that you can launch different CoD games from. People are talking about it less because there’s less of a hype train for each game that comes out, but there is still a very big community."

For me Extra has been a far better as these are games ive really enjoyed rather than predominantly meh games I've gotten with Gamepass over the last 2 years and one or two decent months recently doesn't change that.. PlayStation Extra titles and especially their exclusives and more immersive controller have been the main reason 99% of my gaming time has been spent on PS5.

Tell me the best PS plus month you can recall?PS Plus doesn’t even come vaguely close for your point to make any sense."

Sony may have exclusives, and that is good, but Microsoft has put stake into backwards compatibility this whole time, outshining sony and Nintendo, who should be focused on making it possible to play from their back catalogs of thousands of games.. with only having a ps5, I feel locked out from enjoying the games from my past, or ones I never got to play. In that sense I'd say gamepass comes out as the winner, as you have an almost limitless amount of games, and how many coop games to play from the past with family and friends. But to each their own. Just saying my peace."

My current replay of Fallout 4 literally started last November and I’m only just on the verge of wrapping it up. It took me basically all summer to get through Mass Effect Legendary Edition from December’s PS Plus. The single player games I’ve finished this year would probably be three or four months’ worth of gameplay when I was 14.I have several games on my radar (Cyberpunk, Alien Isolation, RDR2) that I haven’t bought yet simply because I’ve been busy playing other games and haven’t had the time to justify purchasing them when they would just be gathering dust on my shelf for months. I can’t even remember the last time I bought and played a game on literal day one; maybe CoD Ghosts back in 2013? When a pricey AAA game is on PS Plus, I’m genuinely excited, because I really am getting it “for free” and will have it available whenever I get the time to play it. This includes games like Mass Effect, which I enjoyed playing but probably wouldn’t have ever bought with my own money because I wasn’t sure if it was the type of RPG I’d like, and Cold War, which is a fun little romp that I never would’ve invested money into."

U can increase price get a big bump but down the line u fall below your benchmark sooner than later. Its like netflix and blockbuster with late fees. Yeah block buster was top of the game off ruining ppl credit but they died 5 years after netflix came along cuz they didnt adjust pricing or model. While ps plus may not have cheaper comp on the ps (cuz we all know about gamepass) they can lose favor with customers based solely on the idea other subs are cheaper and more useful like spotify or apple music and if u gotta choose why not keep ur multiplatform music over paying for online multiplayer?

Especially since Sony doesn't put 1st party or 3rd party stuff on it day 1 like MS does with gamepass. Makes the value just fade away really. With the way game prices drop like a rock these days it's just hard to justify anymore. Me personally won't be renewing as I like to actually own my games but was willing to be sub'd when the value proposition made sense.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/177vek1/octobers_ps_plus_monthly_games_see_secondlowest/,ocbdare,3 mo. ago,"Yes. I renewed in Jul 2023 before they even announced the price increase. However, even before the price increase it was quite a bit of money as I mostly only care about online and cloud saves. I rarely play the ps plus games as I have big libraries on both Playstation and PC.With the new increase, I am definitely dropping my PS plus when it expires. I am also shifting all my purchases of online games (and likely all multiplats) to PC. I've recently bought MK 1, Diablo 4 and will soon buy Call of Duty MW3 all on PC.I want to make sure I am not stuck not being able to play my games when PS plus expires. And the lack of cloud saves is an issue if my console breaks down. So they will lose money from both the ps plus essentials sub and I won't buy any more online games. My PS5 is now strictly relegated to PlayStation exclusives. Not sure how many other people who own other platforms will do something similar.I would love it if there was a cheaper tier below Essentials that only offered online and cloud saves. I don't want the PS Essentials games. But I know they will never do it as a lot of people are ""forced"" into Essentials because of the online access.I think they will start to see more and more subs drop as people's subs expire over the next 6 to 10 months."

Gamepass on PC is £8x12 = £96 a year. But often can find discounts to make it cheaper. Just Call of Duty MW3 is £60. But the thing that will absolutely bring me on board is if they include World of Warcraft in Gamepass. Then I might be a long term game pass subscriber.

Cloud gaming? Really? It is the worst tier by far because of this alone. Like, you mean to tell me they couldn't bother to emulate 20 year old software? And having to PAY in order to play a DEMO is beyond absurd.And in some countries, including my own, it's even worse, we get the ""Deluxe"" tier instead, which has only the ported, downloadable versions of a few ps1, ps2, and ps3 games, which are less than 130 games, most of them being niche, the regular person would be interested in maybe 10 of them at most.Meanwhile, Xbox gamepass ultimate is 3/5 the price of PS Premium, you get day one first party releases, you can download games all the way from the first xbox and play them without having to worry about bad connection, and if you don't think you need all that, you can just get the Xbox gamepass core (which is basically the lowest tier) for a lower price and still get a few great games to play around with, for 20$ less than PS' Essential plan."

You have access to these permanently as long as you remain subscribed, even if you go for a while without a subscription you’ll get back access to them once you resubscribe.PSPlus Extra is a huge catalogue of games that are updated mid-month (and is what this post is talking about). As long as you’re subscribed to this tier you have access to all games on the catalogue, but games leave the catalogue once in a while and you’d lose access to those. Games are added mid-month for this. I think it’s the 3rd Tuesday each month.As long as you sub to a level, you get all the lower benefits too, so Premium has the benefits of Extra and Extra has the monthly games for Essential."

Games usually last quite a while on the catalogue so as long as you get to playing it you won’t have any issues finishing them. You go to ‘buy’ the game, but similar to when a game goes on regular PSPlus instead of the price it’ll say you can claim it."

And I'm not saying that due to the list of games available, I'm referring to the Streaming feature and Game Trials. Both of those features were just as important to me as the monthly list of games. I have a fast connection so I stream the games a lot and it's a game-changing feature so I can try out new games before going through the trouble of taking time to download them. If I like the game I can choose to download or keep streaming if I don't want to hog up my drive space. Game Trials gives me the opportunity to play the full version of new AAA titles that are not on Extra."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/13du3w4/playstation_plus_game_catalog_lineup_for_may/,hikikomori021,8 mo. ago,How do those premium trials work? Do you get like an hour to play or a level?
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/13du3w4/playstation_plus_game_catalog_lineup_for_may/,Null,8 mo. ago,Depends on the game. Some games give anywhere from 4 to 5 hours to play the game and other games give one to two hours. The game trials gives you the full game as if you bought it. Nothing is locked. All levels are available. But you get just the time they give you to play the game. There’s a time clock that counts down so you know how long you’ll have to play. You can stop playing and go play a different games and come back later and the time clock continues. So these are not like game demos where game demos are locked to certain areas of the game. You get the actual full game. That’s why I like the game trials.

Then the JRPG is kind of a game in itself, but blends with the life sim stuff really well.You cook crops for food and create equipment in the life sim to gear up for combat delves, then from the loot you get and animals you capture, it builds up your farm and gives you more materials to adventure with.Everything is a skill: farming, chopping wood, raising animals, fishing, walking, bathing, eating, swords, magic, shopkeeping, sleeping - the more you do any of those things, the more it raises your stats depending on the skill. All of the systems blend together in a way that’s hard to describe."

Don’t be alarmed by how complex it seems though, it’s not as demanding as you’d think.For example: in your fields, every square of soil has a level, with exp, growth speed, quality modifiers, crop size percentages, fertiliser types and even HP. That sounds crazy but you could literally play the entire game ignoring all of that and still get on fine.It’s only really there for people who want to min/max the farming, or if you’re out to grow ultra rare crops. You can even grow crops which you can use as weapons and shields, or crops which literally turn into dungeons you can explore.Don’t be afraid to just play it whilst relaxing and ignore the complex stuff, but if you ever want more then there are plenty of handy “things you should know” guides and videos if you want to take it more seriously."

Another generation lost.our vision is that everybody who's on console has to feel like they have a great experience and they're a first-class citizen, they've invested a tonne in our platform.I don't know about console but the Xbox game pass app on PC is a third-class experience and Microsoft needs to do a lot more to make it even palatable."

I have both PS Plus Premium and XBox Gamepass on PC. XBox game pass on PC is better value than PS Plus Premium. One of the main reasons is XBox Gamepass gets Day 1 games for pretty big titles like Wo Long. PS Plus won't release Day 1 games that are big titles on Day 1 (small titles maybe, but nothing like Wo Long). Plus, all the Microsoft AAA games like Forza Horizon 5, MSFS, AoE 4, etc, are released on Gamepass, Day 1. In general Gamepass has a lot of AAA games that release on Day 1, unlike PS Plus which I haven't seen release any big budget AAA games on Day 1.I have a sweet spot for Square/Enix and JRPGs so I like PS Plus a lot because of this, but if I didn't have this bias towards Square/Enix and JRPGs, by far, Gamepass is better."

When I played it on PS4pro the loading time was INSANE - it was frustrating, so I had to drop the difficulty down so as to not die so much, but that brought down the thrill of combat. Anyway its free with your subscription, so would recommend checking it out."

If they cared.But also even if they don’t it doesn’t actually affect Sony.You can already sell your game once you’ve played it and they don’t see that revenue, that already happens a ton anyway to the point Microsoft tried to prevent it back in last gen launch.As for the family sharing, you can already do that, you just can’t play them at the same time. Since most games sit on the shelf most of their lives, and it only takes a week at most to complete most games, so a friend just has to be a little bit patient and they can borrow it for free already.So technically, it wouldn’t effect Sony at all.

But I’m bad at them so I had to change the control scheme and play it slower.You can slow time with a dodge/jump (think Max Payne). And there are environmental effects - immersive sim elements to it too, shooting lanterns to douse enemies on fire, that sort of thing.But I found it slightly gimmicky and a little hard to plan properly when chaos breaks out in battle."

The game gets constant updates and, by extension, a constant stream of new players either intrigued by its legendary comeback or wanting to play a new update. Perhaps in a few years, if the player count begins to wane, it might end up on Plus trying to support itself.Cyberpunk is a game I don’t see on Essential soon. It might headline an Extra drop in a year or two, but considering the fact that it’s currently riding the wave of both the 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty I simply don’t see it soon.Games that climbed out of their disastrous launch state, like Battlefront 2, only came to Plus when their player base was shrinking and updates had stopped. Both NMS and Cyberpunk are games that are flourishing and enjoying continuous support from their devs, and I just don’t see them coming soon."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1131zzf/playstation_plus_game_catalog_lineup_for_february/,Null,11 mo. ago,"SMH Gamepass has never been anything extraordinary. PlayStation plus premium has over three times the amount of games and PlayStation plus extra alone has still more games and award-winning exclusives than Gamepass and we get free games every month on the lowest tier. Plus the entire service on all three tiers is cheaper yearly than gamepass. I’m sorry, but I’m tired of hearing the overrated Gamepass is so awesome line as if it’s so much better than PlayStation plus when it really isn’t."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1131zzf/playstation_plus_game_catalog_lineup_for_february/,Fluffy_Artichoke_723,11 mo. ago,"I mean, I wouldn't know as I don't have an XBOX. But from what I understand, GP gave access to new games as well as old and that's been severely lacking until now. The newest one we got close to release was Stray."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1131zzf/playstation_plus_game_catalog_lineup_for_february/,Null,11 mo. ago,"That’s understandable, because people from the Xbox side are always overrating game pass. They don’t care for PlayStation at all, so they put down the PlayStation. PlayStation plus has always been better than Gamepass. Those Day1 titles are not hardly coming out once or twice a year maybe and they’re not AAA titles. That’s what they don’t tell you. It’s really Sony‘s fault for not advertising PlayStation plus enough. It’s really an amazing service. Just the free monthly games we get every single month on the lowest tier, makes it an amazing service and we just add them to our library and they never go away from the service. There’s nothing on game pass that offers that. Right before Christmas Sony gave us the new hot wheels game on the free monthly games. We get to keep it permanently as long as people added it to their library. It was just recently added a gamepass and it’s not a guarantee that it will stay on gamepass."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1131zzf/playstation_plus_game_catalog_lineup_for_february/,SolidVegetable,11 mo. ago,"Some of the recent PS Plus drops were good but there is a couple of things that the service lacks compared to Game Pass:First-party games day one (yes, Xbox didn’t have many of these recently but it will change this year)Constant stream of good indie games that many wouldn’t buy without trying them firstDay-one third-party releases, especially of some great indie gamesNo BS like this month in PS Plus with Resident Evil 7. If there is a game added, it’s always both XOne and Series versions (the only exception I can think of is NBA 2k ~2 years ago)Not to mention that Sony’s marketing on this sucks compared to Microsoft’s. Plus, Microsoft supposedly treats indie devs better than Sony which I imagine has some impact on the number of indie day-one games in Game Pass."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17h98dx/my_walmart_still_sells_ps_12_months_for_5999_usd/,smackerly,2 mo. ago,I'm pretty sure they just convert to the equivalent of the new pricing. So you wouldn't get a year. Then again I'm not 100% but if you're interested I'd say just get one to be safe and try it.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17h98dx/my_walmart_still_sells_ps_12_months_for_5999_usd/,Luke-Hatsune,2 mo. ago,Is that even legally allowed? Since you’re paying $60 for 12 months and people who don’t know about the 30% price increase would assume they’d get PS+ for a year. If they convert it to less than a year you’ll technically be getting a service that was incorrectly marketed when the product was sold.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17h98dx/my_walmart_still_sells_ps_12_months_for_5999_usd/,hellodon,2 mo. ago,"It would 100% be false advertising unless there’s fine print on there that covers this type of situationYou can’t say there are 24 cookies in a package for a certain price then put 16 cookies in there and tell the consumer “oh, yeah we raised our prices, but you paid for what we now charge for 16 cookies, so even though it says 24, you still got your “money’s worth”. “I don’t think these cards work like that anyway. The price you pay doesn’t determine the length of service you get. I never paid 59.99, always got the year codes for less than 59.99 and it always redeemed for a year, it didn’t give me less because I paid less. The code is in exchange for 12 months of service no matter what you pay for it - as long as it’s activated.If Sony wanted to ensure these weren’t out in the wild, I would think they’d kill the activation process on the SKU so they’re dead and can’t even be activated"
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17h98dx/my_walmart_still_sells_ps_12_months_for_5999_usd/,smackerly,2 mo. ago,They very well could have killed the activation codes. The cards probably should have been pulled by retailers but haven't been. They are outdated.If I bought a Microsoft points card from 360 era I doubt I'd get that value in store credit on xbox.The fact that a class action lawsuit hasn't been brought against Sony for these is proof that somewhere be it on the cards or in their tos they have covered themselves and it isn't false advertising.

I was going to buy a year for 59.99 in late August from Sony direct and went with the Extra plan for 40.00 more at 99.99. Got an email saying it will renew in a year for 99.99…then a few weeks later got an email saying it’s gonna be 134.99. Haven’t even looked, what did they raise a year of standard to?It would take a lot of people getting these and complaining for a class action suit to happen down the line. I’m sure most retailers removed them as instructed. Walmart probably missed a spot, they have gift cards all over the place.I have a feeling they have covered their bases in the fine print on these things…"

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/10o8mpp/leak_ps_plus_essential_february_2023_games_by/,pants207,11 mo. ago,but it is a DLC for a free game owned by sony that has a major expansion coming out mid February.

Shitty streaming? If Sony  isn't finding it worthwhile, just make a sepreate service for classic games only, charge for it accordingly, but give us 300-400 best games right from the start.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1098xjf/playstation_plus_game_catalog_lineup_for_january/,Pyramat,1 yr. ago,Pretty sure the reason they're not adding any PS2 games is because the PS2 emulator is broken on PS5 and Sony doesn't want to put in the effort to fix it. It's a damn shame because there's so many great PS2 games that could be added.

PS plus is not a product, is a service that allows you to play games included in the tier. If you remove what you call “free games”, what would you be paying for? Literally, you are saying that you are paying to play free games, how does that make sense?As I said before, the wording you are using is exactly as if you purchased a travel pack and then started to say “hey, I got a flight for free”.

I don't think I communicated what I was trying to say. Some got bundles as that was the only way to buy a PlayStation 5 for a while - at least where I live, meaning the price of the game was ""free"" as that was just the going rate of a console as there were no unbundled consoles available. Thus, they now only have the second one if they did not get ps plus or bought the first one alone. So I get where OP is coming from - and why some might want to skip the first one"

That means a lot of casual non-gamers were buying the units just for those features and not actually buying games. But they were buying movies on disc, which Sony still made licensing money on.Who is buying a PS5 and then paying $159 a year just for movie access? It is a nice benefit for existing users but it is not going to tempt the non-gamer. They will just continue using firesticks or smart TV's and subscribing to the streaming services they already use.And is this really the route Sony really wants to go down? Competing against Xbox in the media landscape?I thought the Xbox One failed because people thought it focused too much on media features like film streaming instead of gaming?

Base tier is just $6.67 a month. That's literally a 20 oz coffee.This conversation reminds me of how convinced everyone was Netflix would fail and lose subs and profit.Or how reddit charging 3rd party devs for use of the reddit api and how now reddit would fail.Guess what? Neither of those things happened. And it'll be the same here.I support your own rejection and protest of a price increase. That's all good. Just don't expect most to actually cancel their subscription over it.

How that decline is distributed amongst them is hard to predict, but I do know that “many” cannot “easily” afford the prices hikes across the board.

That’s essential tier. So don’t equate the OP comment differently than how it was constructed. It’s just not constructive argument.I don’t about others but I’ve completed like 14 AAA-AA games this year through ps extra. And I’m not even much of a gamer compared to people that play exclusively multiplayer games. And I’ve certainly got my moneys worth for an extra 30 bucks per year.And OP is right. That’s piss away money for well to do consumers and the frugal or economically disadvantaged alike. 30-50 dollars across an entire year is like 15 “dollar menu” items from a fast food joint.The point being, Reddit is literally no indication of how the general public responds to situations like this. The amount of disassociation with the regular world on Reddit is sometimes rather baffling. I have reread and rewatched a thread and video of a COLLEGE EDUCATED girl, complain about a standard work week and I went to the comments to just see… delusional pandering. As if the smart phones they were commenting with weren’t made by overworked engineers and slave like over seas labor. Who would have guessed that production hours matter to society? Are we meant to only consume? Or do people think Chinese laborers don’t deserve rights? “They can work 80 hours a week but I can’t manage even 40. It’s just too much.” How did this young woman go through college not understanding the concept of a 40 hour work week?And Redditors clamored behind her.

Like, all the people that said they’d delete reddit over the Apollo nonsense, i indexed those pages out if curiosity and upon inspection in the aftermath (like 3 months out) to find the mass majority of those users didn’t delete their accounts and were still active.So I’m just reiterating again, while the reddit outrage may be vocal, it’s hardly representative of the general public.But you’re right, these subscriptions just keep mounting and at a certain point people need to start cutting unnecessary services.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17htoc0/sony_reveals_that_13_of_the_ps_plus_user_base_has/,RedGoldEmerald,2 mo. ago,After the initial change I upgraded my essential to premium cuz it was only $5 more than extra. When it was time to renew (around the holidays) I could either keep premium for $90 or downgrade to extra for $100 or essential for $60 (so no savings to renew if I downgraded). I was planning on going with extra anyway so I stuck with premium since it cost less. Now with the price change and my next renewal date coming up I’m leaning towards cancelling my sub or strategic monthly subs to get two months games for the price of one or not be subbed for a month where they don’t add games I want. I figure paying for 6 months out of the yea r not only save me money but incentivizes me to prioritize those ps plus games rather than add them to my backlog since I can’t just play them whenever I want like if I had a recurring yearly sub

They were the first games to really highlight and utilize analogue. One stick to move the other to catch the escaped monkey.After a couple of releases on the PS1 and throw in a release on the PSP, I think most people are just shocked we manage to get a new version every month.In my mind it just highlights how poor the classic offering is. There are so many games in the PS1 and PS2 library we could have and yet all we seem to get is Ape Escape."

Like attempting to flirt with Miss Oranje Disco Dancer at the very start lmao. So, save often, but just roll with whatever the game gives you and try not to save scum.edit: I wanna put extra emphasis on saving often. Not just in case there’s a check you want to see succeed, but also because I ran into a couple save bugs last time I played on PS5. I’d consider making a hard save during times such as when you’ve passed a big check, when you’ve finished a long conversation, or before a conversation that seems important."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/168mp04/buying_years_of_ps_plus_in_bulk_is_playing_right/,Lilmoblin,4 mo. ago,you can’t do math. first off it’s a bigger number than 1 for the subscription. second off both the increase and the sale are multiplicative of the price not additive or subtractive. so (100 * 1.33)-(100 * 0.75) = 108. exactly 8% like the other guy said.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/168mp04/buying_years_of_ps_plus_in_bulk_is_playing_right/,Null,4 mo. ago,"I was joking FYI, because it's an error a lot of people make at quick glance. I figured a lot of people would just do 33 - 25 and say 8!You're forgetting to add the 33% increase to the base before subtracting the discount.It wouldn't be 100 * 0.75. It would be (100 * 1.33) * 0.75. Which is 99.75."

I have extra, it’s saved me a tonne of money since owning it and I always said it would be a better service if you could bundle + and now together. That being said I never saw any value in premium and I’ve been shocked seeing how many people on this sub alone had it. I’ll be keeping extra but I’ll still only  be purchasing it on the sales, the way I see it, it’s still cheaper than my mid-tier Netflix and I use it everyday unlike Netflix that can go a couple of months at a time never being used."

I got it initially because it was pro-rated with my current plus subscription. Then a sale occurred, but I could only get a discount on my current subscription. I couldn't just buy a year of extra that would kick in once the premium ended. So I bought premium for ~$100. Basically I'd have to let my premium end and then buy extra, most likely at full price. Maybe there's a way around this, but I haven't figured it out yet."

You're paying even less per game for Extra and Premium, since the available catalogues have ~400 and ~800 games.Sure, everyone's tastes are different and if you're not getting your money's worth, you should stop subbing.

Sony (and Microsoft) just arbitrarily decided they wanted to charge for multiplayer in paid games on their platform. It's just greed.I.e. Warzone and MW3 run on the same Activision servers. Since Warzone is free, PS Plus isn't needed. But MW3? You need PS Plus to play.It was still tolerable when the pricing was low enough that you begrudgingly paid it. But now, paying $110 (in Canada) a year just to play multiplayer is insane."

I mean some will but I'm sure people are leaving in droves."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ogzy9/insomniac_leak_unveils_sonys_plans_for_expansion/,L2-46V,7 days ago,"I think they’re taking the cable TV/ISP/mobile service provider approach: many people will drop out every year hoping for a deal, and there’s an internal policy for dealing with those people when that happens. For example, if they call and complain, you get the customer service rep who says “I’ve been approved to give you a special offer.” New and returning customer offers also exist to deal with this.Many people will go “whatever” and leave on auto-renew (which is why Sony takes every opportunity they can to turn it back on without asking). So they get to squeeze a little extra from those people. In that sense, yes, they do expect many existing customers to resub at the full amount. It doesn’t have to be all of us, it doesn’t even have to be most of us, it just has to be enough of us.Dealing with everyone else may seem like extra effort on their part, but while it seems like they’re having to deal with millions of people “case by case” they’re really just applying a different policy to engage with us, and we actually end up doing most of the work for them: we call and ask for a deal, or we let our sub lapse in hopes of getting that automated email offering us one. Even then, the “deal” isn’t much of a deal. If you were in the habit of resubbing every Black Friday, you were paying $40 a year. Now the best deal you’re going to get is closer to $60.Sadly, yes, by complicating the pricing process the way they have, many people will in fact throw up their hands and pay the full price because they need the service to continue playing the online games they’ve grown accustomed to playing.All of this is what they’re literally banking on, and when you’re positioned in the market the way they are, this usually works. Pretty much everyone hates their ISP and mobile provider (which for many is the same company), but everyone needs a phone and internet, so that company doesn’t need you to love them. You need them more than they need your love, so they’ll happily accept your ongoing subscription payments whether you like them or not.Sony is banking on the possibility that they have that level of significance in enough of their customers’ homes, so those customers don’tneedto love Sony, they justneedto pay Sony to play the games they do love.Yeah, it’s shitty. It’s shitty and it works."

Back then some people definitely abused the system by stacking absurd amounts of subscription years during Black Friday and Holiday sales while I used to renew and add to my active subscription around that time always a few days before my subscription would be due for renewal anyway.However, this year – since only new and returning customers are eligible now – my PS Plus ended yesterday, but the the Holiday sale with PS Plus already ended on 17 December leaving me with no other choice than either stepping away or waiting for another sale as 126€ for Extra are a little much for me at the moment.I'd even have stuck with PS Plus even if that meant paying the old regular price during a Sale now with the price hike, but Sony doesn't even give long-time – I'm a continuous subscriber for more than ten years – customers that choice anymore.Sony does not value their existing and most loyal customers and it shows – and the worst part is: numbers probably still prove them right."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ogzy9/insomniac_leak_unveils_sonys_plans_for_expansion/,justthisones,8 days ago,Beside the game offerings etc. I find the biggest issue being the price you have to pay for just  some occasional multiplayer gaming. You’re basically forced to pay at least 80$ for some fun with friends online. More often the games you play are not even running on Sony servers so you’re just giving them free money. It’s been driving me away from multiplayer gaming when companies like these should do the opposite.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ogzy9/insomniac_leak_unveils_sonys_plans_for_expansion/,Hot-Pirate9874,8 days ago,"Adding to the rest of the chorus, I also let my PS Plus go. I looked at what games I would actually be losing, and I only came away with like FF7R and Fallen Order. So I just bought Fallen Order for 20 bucks and the twin pack for FF7R that comes with Rebirth and now I’m fully set and won’t be missing anything that was in my catalogue. I think the only way, FOR ME, that I would be confident in getting PS Plus again with this new payment plan is if Essential games were permanently in your library after losing subscription."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18ogzy9/insomniac_leak_unveils_sonys_plans_for_expansion/,boogers19,8 days ago,My trick for Fallen Order is EA Play. It's only like $5/mo or $30/y.

They often have promos of $1 for 3mo or similar.So I've played Fallen Order 3 times for the grand total of $3.

Man, it was so good. I'd highly recommend NOT playing Miles Morales until you play the original game.The game was so good that I even paid for the DLC which was just as enjoyable before jumping into Miles Morales (first time I'd ever paid for DLC). I had the base game in physical form, plus another 10 games I bought when I picked up the console, but I was willing to delay starting the other games just to get more of this game.So anyway, if you can spare £17.99, the Game Of the Year edition is on sale right now in Argos (includes all of the 3 DLC). This is half price and really good value considering the DLC is £14.97 to add to the base game. The base game is generally £20 or more on its own (£22 in CEX second hand for the base game with no DLC). For your £17.99, you'll get absolutely everything and then can enjoy Miles Morales a lot more.No idea how long it's on sale for at Argos so might be worth picking up now even if you don't plan on playing it for a few months/til a later datehttps://www.argos.co.uk/product/2073626?storeID=4323&istCompanyId=a74d8886-5df9-4baa-b776-166b3bf9111c&istFeedId=30f62ea9-9626-4cac-97c8-9ff3921f8558&istItemId=ixmqrqxmt&istBid=t&&cmpid=GS001&_$ja=tsid:59157%7Cacid:534-693-8244%7Ccid:20291201753%7Cagid:%7Ctid:%7Ccrid:%7Cnw:x%7Crnd:11719587686552608084%7Cdvc:m%7Cadp:%7Cmt:%7Cloc:9046955&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=20291201753&utm_term=2073626&utm_content=shopping&utm_custom1=&utm_custom2=534-693-8244&GPDP=true&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZqxnraKHhVfmvwa67a4Xhj4q06kuJ_JdSD1-WSr5dkjv1trrBNeEmRoCAOkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds"

They aren’t bad games now (well, some of them aren’t), but nothing makes them feel special.  If you want great arcade racing, then I think Forza Horizon 3-5 are  the best now, but sadly they are only on Xbox and PC.If you ever enjoyed Gran Turismo, then GT7 is in a really nice spot.

You’d like to vary the gameplay in order not to get bored. They’re well ranked because they’re amazing games, but the gameplay mechanics are just very similar in terms of combat, stealth, exploration, finding and upgrading loot, developing your character skills etc. I think you have a good order on this list, as you don’t have any of these two in a row, but you may want to space them out even more.There are a few short games like the The Dark Pictures Anthology games that are great palate cleansers in between these huge open world games., I’d add them in."

It’s a game that can be replayed a infinite amount of times, the story is possibly the best we’ve ever seen in my video game ever, you WILL actually have feelings for the characters, and you WILL want to replay the game to get a different ending. Days gone I think should be yellow not red, while it isn’t super special, it is a really fun game with a good story. And Batman Arkham knight should be in the green, only if you’ve played the other Arkham games, otherwise the placement it pretty justified. It’s a great end to a great series, a lot of people will say “the bat mobile missions ruined it” but I disagree, I found the batmobile missions fun, innovative, and different from the standard way boss fights were in the original games.

I have to note it's more fast paced than Oblivion, traversal is a core mechanic, and not in the Bethesda way of ""walk up to a nearly sheer cliff face and just keep jumping up it."" It's worth replaying if you don't spoil yourself with guides, run 1 won't be ""perfect"" and THAT'S OK! run 2 go wild and learn what kind of crazy stuff you can pull offOdyssey is NOT a stealth game. It has some stealthy elements, but it's primarily an action rpg. If you try it, you get some freebie cash shop credits. Buy the Bighorn Bow. It's bugged, and they never fixed it. It applies all of its damage to whichever melee weapon is in your left(?) quick swap slot. It can make for some very fun builds later in the game when you want to mess around and go wild. Anything else can technically (somewhat randomly via daily/weekly quests) be obtained in the game for free.If you've played old AC games it's a MASSIVE departure, where Isu lore used to be on the fringes of the plots and only a small bit gets revealed this game goes ""what up, here's 15 hours of story quests and an entire DLC about nothing but sci-fantasy stuff""Control is an eerie third person shooter. It's like a mix of X-Files and Severance vibes mixed with SCP. It's unsettling and creepy but it never goes full survival horror. The PS5 version has a small vibration every. time. you. step. as far as i can tell there's no way to turn it off. it's cute in Astros Playroom, a tech demo, but not for a full game. i'm pretty sure you can still dl the ps4 version onto a ps5 if you don't like it.GOTG was SURPRISINGLY good. it's very engaging in both the story and gameplay. there's a solid mix of comic and movie aspects that it comes out as its own unique third thing. there's also some Telltale style branching story paths. In the end things all come back together, but sometimes there are significant changes that show up hours and hours lateroverall your list is pretty spot on, but i may suggest you swap tiers on uncharted and dishonored based on what you said"

Don't make the same mistake I did.•it takes two should be in the co-op category•overcooked 2? isn't it the all you can eat edition with everything in it? I'd recommend that version because there is so much content for that game it's insane. Wonderful support by a top developer. Id also say it's a delight to play solo too, which may be best if you're married as coop overcooked could end a marriage•AC Odyssey - do not bother with the male character at all. Kassandra is the one. Also be prepared to invest a lot of time, the game is bonkers huge.•Sniper Elite games are fairly ranked but I'd say consider the length, they're great fun if you're looking for a palate cleanser and want to just smash through a game quickly.

Yeah PS+ Extra/Premium is probably not ideal for you. You would be better off just buying what you want.But personally assuming they don't remove everything overnight, I can keep playing games in the Extra/Premium tiers for another two years before I would start to question things. Which is why I doubled down and bought multiple years when it was cheap. I have purchased 2 games since getting the PS5 on launch day: Elden Ring and Bauldersgate3. Every other game I've played comes through the subscription. That is absolutely defendable to me.Judging the service based only on it's new additions each month is completely missing the point of the service. It's like judging Disney+ based only on the dozen or so shows/movies added each year, ignoring the massive collection content.Most people's issues seem to be that they want massive AAA games added every month when in reality the service is clearly designed to give you access to a lot of moderate titles and a few recent AAA games at a time."

They probably had meetings to discuss price hikes and agreed to do it months in advance as well & if they didn't properly plan to align higher quality offerings with when the price hikes went into effect then that's just that, improper planning.Another important reason I don't believe that is the fact the original price hike announcement specifically stated something along the lines of ""these increases are being done to ensure wecontinuebringing you this quality of offerings"".

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17vxf2u/playstation_plus_game_catalog_for_november/,Evanz111,1 mo. ago,"Oof, that doesn’t have an easy answer, so I’ll try my best:For a first time player, it would be best to wait until you’ve finished the main story and hit post game. You’ll know when that is, so I shouldn’t have to spoil. At that point the DLC will be challenging, but you can begin to tackle it.For an experienced or skilled player you can genuinely tackle it from the beginning of the playthrough. You’ll have to be creative and resourceful, and likely avoid enemies, but you can get a ton of good loot early on.However, there’s nothing stopping you as a first time player from going there whenever you like mid-playthrough, and seeing what it’s like. It’ll be dangerous, but very rewarding if you go there early. It’s just balanced for higher level players with endgame gear, so the fights will be very difficult. Similar to the dark zone from The Division, I guess.You can go there and back as you wish, so there’s no harm in trying when you feel up to it! Just don’t worry if it seems impossibly difficult at first, one day you’ll be strong enough to breeze through it."

This is a game worth three or four times its base price in sheer quality, so if you haven't tried it I'd 1000000% recommend it.And lastly, just because the price for PS+ increased dramatically doesn't mean every game that isn't an amazing deal is automatically shit.EDIT: You can downvote me all you want, but because you don't like what I'm saying doesn't mean it's wrong.

Also the first few hours of Dragon's Dogma are the worst, but that's mostly the case for every RPG. I have nearly 500 hours across the original PS3 release, the PS3 Dark arisen release, the PS4 Dark arisen release, and even the switch release and aside from my first playthrough I basically sprint through the first small hunk of the game. Once you get to Gran Soren, the game becomes phenomenal and then the combat within the Dark Arisen expansion is some of the best content for any game I've ever played. I would go take a look at some gameplay for DD2 because aside from Shadow of the Erdtree there's nothing I'm more hyped about right now."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17vxf2u/playstation_plus_game_catalog_for_november/,kfrazi11,1 mo. ago,"I feel the exact same way, the only reason why we don't have a sequel yet is because in 2016 Capcom told the lead developer that he could choose between making Dragon's Dogma 2 and Devil May Cry 5. Considering he didn't even work on the DMC4, he decided to make a sequel. Then we have the pandemic which slowed everything else down, so the fact that we are still getting it is a miracle in and of itself. It's just a tragedy that we didn't get Dragon's Dogma online here in the West even considering DD1 garnered here, kind of the same with the Monster Hunter MMO"

Deep story and lore, fantastic action combat with some very unique mechanics, a surprisingly high amount of replayability, etc.If you're a fan of say, Skyrim, Dark Souls or Monster Hunter, you'll almost definitely enjoy it, and even if you're not an RPG person it's still worth at least giving a shot."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17vxf2u/playstation_plus_game_catalog_for_november/,BigFatStupidMoose,2 mo. ago,Its a cult classic. A game with great elements but its flawed and will turn of a lot of people cause it lacks things people will expect from ita genre. Great combat and unique mechanics with the pawns leads to exciting battles but most people looking for open world rpgs arent looking for good combat and get turned off when they find out it doesnt have much story or character interaction. Tends to appeal more to Souls fans than Dragon Age fans you might say.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17vxf2u/playstation_plus_game_catalog_for_november/,frankyb89,2 mo. ago,I love it and have played it at least 3 times over the years.  Though there is plenty of jank or things that could bother players.  But then there are so many little things that I'm sad have never been done again and other little things that really add to the game.  I wish any magic in any other game felt as impactful as this one.If you're already paying for the membership I'd suggest downloading and trying it out at the very least.

Although I gave teardown a shot it’s some good fun and genius in there although the levels feel a bit empty unfortunately.-sea of stars -disco elysium -hotline Miami -Eldest souls -Far shoreThose are a few games in the catalogue that most people won’t bother playing but are abso-lutely worth it."

We're not talking about what's the better console. I don't even own a xbox1, series S nor series X. We're talking about internet subscriptions for said consoles.

It has nothing to do with the console. Psplus essential cost $20 more a year and for what? Since you're still stuck on console wars, if you were to ask me what the better console is, I'd say PlayStation because of it's superior game library.

Can get a £20 gift card a month. Compared to PS Stars and you need to spend £200 to get a £20 gift card because the points expire after a year. You also get priority customer service when you got level 3 or 4 of Stars which is just fucking gross.

And not to mention that these games aren't permanently yours now that you have bought it. It's already pretty bad that digital games do not belong to the customer, but the fact that PlayStation can just yoink these games from players who paid for them through their subscription is just stupid to try and justify the price increases.Inorder to justify the massive price increase (especially at the highest tier) they should have definitely made it a discount for new PlayStation exclusive games + early access. For example, players at the highest tier of PS+ should get a 3 day early access to the new Spider-Man game as well as get some sort of discount. But of course they would never do that"

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17zs6n1/brand_new_2_hour_game_trial_for_baldurs_gate_3/,HelpfulApple22,1 mo. ago,"Honestly, I was expecting more than the standard 2 hours (well, it used to be standard). The Witcher and Cyberpunk both have 5 hour trials. Even Ragnarök has a 3 hour trial. BG3 is a huge RPG which also has a huge character creator. In a game that lets me fine tune my character to the point where I have control over whether my character is circumcised or not, I’d want a little more time to move my character for more than 5 seconds."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17zs6n1/brand_new_2_hour_game_trial_for_baldurs_gate_3/,SlowJay11,1 mo. ago,It's just a demo so I suppose the idea is you can gloss over that part to get into the game to see if you like it.

So while it is theoretically the full-game, it is not the full-game in practice. It's called a ""trial"" after all. If you decide to waste it all in character creation that's a user problem."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17zs6n1/brand_new_2_hour_game_trial_for_baldurs_gate_3/,SlowJay11,1 mo. ago,"A demo or a trial aren't meaningfully different to the user, in both cases you're sampling the game for a limited time, only one allows saves.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17zs6n1/brand_new_2_hour_game_trial_for_baldurs_gate_3/,MiG-15,1 mo. ago,Itisdifferent because you're not getting a curated experience like in a demo.You're getting as much of the normal game you can experience in a limited amount of time which doesn't always work for all games.Especially ones that start slow and make people obsess over character creation.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17zs6n1/brand_new_2_hour_game_trial_for_baldurs_gate_3/,dscchn,1 mo. ago,"Just to add an example, RE8 Village had actual demos that were time restricted but were mere snippets from a much larger story. I remember a lot of people online being fooled into believing the entire game would revolve around Dimitrescu, after playing the ‘Castle’ demo. I think even theradbrad said something along the lines of “I wonder why they named the game village instead of castle”. A true curated experience, as you said."
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17zs6n1/brand_new_2_hour_game_trial_for_baldurs_gate_3/,MiG-15,1 mo. ago,Yeah that's definitely a potential negative of a demo. It can pick and choose the best part or parts to make the game look better than it might be overall.Whereas if you're playing a timed trial you're experiencing the same game from the beginning that everyone does.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17zs6n1/brand_new_2_hour_game_trial_for_baldurs_gate_3/,This_Bottle_6375,1 mo. ago,"Yeah but let's say that I start a save with a character during the trial and I get a bit of a ways into it and run out of time. If I buy or somehow get access to the game later, I'd want to come off with the character I created in trial,  because we all know we on always satisfied with how they look probably until a cutscene.I've had a couple of games that I've been through before I got a PS5 and I didn't have any cloud saves and it was a big bummer having to start over.Like Mass effect legendary edition, I started that on PS4 like a year or two ago but when I went to PS5, only then that I noticed Addy Shep was pale white and like supergoth gf, I mean for some reason I guess I made her way too pale and out of place, It was even worse when aliens were near. I started the whole 1st damn game over, But since I got to go back through the missions and stuff I just already seen I haven't even been back to finish any of them. Cuz it's time-consuming.I know it's not all PS related but if I start a trial I'd like to continue if I buy the game from where I left off so I'm not losing progress and if you're creating a character which is a feature do you really want to just go off half cocked, make a character that you don't like as much as you thought, and then have to start all the way over again?Like most games the intro is probably the first thing you see and it's probably the most effective part of introducing you to it so if you got a play through that over and over it kind of takes away. You only really get one time to fully experience something for the first time.Oh you got the other BS where I start a game that is on the PlayStation Plus catalog and then they take it off when I'm halfway through it, or right when I just started.Basically I like having a trial because I can access the whole game create my character and all that stuff and go, and see if I like the game. But it is annoying when like every little piece of the game is on a time limit so you are not really enjoying it to the fullest, which is fair enough. However, avoiding the character creator you're missing a lot of the game like I don't even know how the fuck that even counts as gameplay. I wish they'd have like little breaks in the game where time didn't apply, like let's say after you get out of creating a character, then it really goes into effect or after you get out the menu or whatever.I don't know I'm going to shut up I'm rambling now but I mean it did kind of annoy me because some of these games do not work well with a trial because of the way they begin."

The combat being turned based is not to everyone’s liking (personally I enjoy that form of combat), so get a couple of battles in and see what’s what. Two hours is enough to know if you’ll enjoy it. That being said a few more hours wouldn’t have hurt for sure! It’s a 100+ hour campaign EASY so giving people a little more time wouldn’t result in a “done it all don’t need it now” mentality."

Though, it should be noted that it's a pretty sizable expansion and Destiny 2 is a live service game, similar to an MMO, that is a pretty different model than other F2P games like Apex Legends or Fortnite. Beyond Light gives you access to a subclass that's unlocked through an 8ish hour campaign, a raid, and loot-based quests. It's a nice bit of content for new players and people who are playing at the free tier.That being said, I don't think Beyond Light is the best entry point to the story of Destiny, and Bungie a lot of work to do to improve the new player experience. There is an intro quest, but then it kinda throws you into the deep end of the pool. There are some helpful guides over onr/Destiny2"

I don't know why they would do it, because the story was good, a great introduction for new players and to hook you into playing. Unfortunately, after the removal it is terrible, I haven't seen a worse game for new players. Almost no story, they push you into some kind of multiplayer mission without really explaining what's going on. I mean they had everything that was needed. I don't understand decisions like that."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/10qyzg1/playstation_plus_monthly_games_for_february_evil/,Depredor,11 mo. ago,"You can link your PC and PlayStation accounts through Bungie's crossplay thing on their website. You'd then be able to play your character on either platform, and play with people on PC, Xbox, and PSN. Most of your old weapons are likely trash now, unfortunately, but any exotics would still be fine. A few years ago, Destiny 2 had some problems with the meta and powercreep, which Bungie decided to solve with a system called sunsetting. People hated it and they've changed the system going forward, but old guns are still affected and no longer viable in PVE.The way weapons and armor work have been revised a number of times and in my opinion, majorly improved since launch. Weapons released in the last year have some interesting perk pools, and weapon crafting has been added. Also, a recent change to the way armor mods are acquired removed a huge, annoying roadblock for new and returning players, so creating your character's build is better than it was a month ago."

After all, there is a work behind it too.They don’t do this kind of things because they love to work for free for us, they do it because it improves their brand image, make them more relevant during more time and they get bigger benefit from it. If Sony charge us extra for these kind of things is because they think they can get more profit than offering it for free, if MS creates their Smart Delivery is because they think it will improve their image and attract more customers to their system.

Sony doesn’t charge you for the upgrade because it’s fair, but because they can make a profit out of it. Same reason MS offers Smart Delivery free of charge. So we, as customers, are the ones that will decide with our actions if Sony starts copying Nintendo or Microsoft.Your argument about fairness was about the work required to port to the new generation. I still don’t understand how that argument doesn’t apply to updates, both for bugfixing and for new content, or how it’s fair to pay if the game is old but it’s unfair if the game is new.

I also personally vibe with the Arkane storytelling style, where you get like 60% of it from game events and cutscenes or whatever, and have to piece together the rest from scraps of paper, tapes, etc. I also enjoy the multiplayer a lot, FPS's generally aren't that exciting to me but the asymmetrical balance is a refreshing twist on a tired formula.IMO it's definitely worth it to try it out, I've been super happy that I bought it on sale for like $20 before it was on Plus."

That said, you could be out in the boonies far enough that it really does take multiple hops over less than ideal networks to reach you.You can use the traceroute command (tracert on Windows) to see the hops between you and the datacenter you're connecting to. If you post that here, I may have some more specific insight for you. Remember that the performance of streaming media is more dependent on latency than bandwidth. So the number of milliseconds required to traverse the hops to the destination is what you'll want to focus on.The performance of the streaming service is monitored continuously. If there are many people in one area struggling to play the games, it will be investigated and possibly result in another PoP being created if that's what is necessary to resolve it.Discaimer: The ideas and opinions expressed here are my own and are not necessarily the opinion of Sony PlayStation or any of its affiliates.

Once you see what that address is then you’d find it’s location according to the IP and then try and speed test with a server located close to it.

Not long ago, I got a USB wifi adapter than was injecting as much as 500ms of latency into every tenth packet sent. It made conferencing extremely annoying.

So anyone with a PS5 basically got one less game that month. And the concern is that there are 6 games they might still do this for.If OPs data is correct, this happened 3x after the Essential collection was released.

I just don't think you're silly if you expected them to be kept up.Imo, there should be just two tiers, ps+ (online multiplayer + monthly games) and ps+ premium (everything else).Trials should be free to everyone regardless of whether they subscribe to either service. Why would you charge for digital game demos? And as a developer, wouldn't you want everyone to be able to try your game?The games on playstation plus collection should all just be part of the premium service.And the work Sony have done so far with classic games doesn't justify the third tier bracket they currently have imo.MS literally dumped almost every first party game they ever made (from OG XB to current gen) on day one for gamepass. Hell, even the tight arses over at Nintendo are adding at least a handful of good classic games each month. The offering from Sony on that third tier have been absolutely abysmally for the last few months; a slow drip feed of crap."

We'll see in a few months, I'm sure those AAA titles will come rolling in too, maybe even some of the ones from Sonys studios, I mean, you'd imagine if they were whacking up the prices they'd put a few of them on rather than Phantasy Star Disco Dancer 42+ Reimagined (sorry I made that up, don't get excited) or whatever bollocks we get every month"

Some people can find some joy in the games like gotham knights, saints row or Calisto protocol if only for a little while. Many people would never buy those titles outright.The price increase will never be ""justified"" in the way you want because  Sony still wants you to buy games that didn't flop at least. The price increase was just because they want more money,but of course they can't just plainly say that they have to make it sound like they are going to improve by adding ps5 streaming which should have already been available anyway and Sony pictures so you can watch movies instead of getting ps2 classic games.I already downgraded my subscription to essential and I already own most of the big games for last month and this month like nier repilicant, 13 sentinels, diso elysium, alien isolation, this war of mine, gotham knights, and star ocean divine force."

I’m more than willing to buy my games at full price to support the studio, devs, whatever, so I’m all for voting with my wallet.I think my issue with ps plus is that for the current price it was serviceable. For mid tier games, game trials, and to play older games it was fine. To jump it up as much as they did without adding value is ridiculous and I think people should not only unsubscribe but let Sony know exactly why they’re fucking up. If you’re gonna piss on my cup and call it lemonade, it’s one thing for me not to buy it, but if I’ve already paid for one cup and you increase the price for a second cup, I reserve the right to tell you what you can do with said cup.

As much as I hate to admit it, I am one of those. I got a PS only a few years ago mostly to play with my friends and I really enjoy it. However, I'm gonna pay the $80 to play with my buddies, no doubt it's worth that for me. If the lowest tier was $100 I would begrudgingly pay it because for me the whole point of owning the system is to play online with my friends.

Last year I paid $75 for the extra tier and it was really worth it. I played easily double that value in games and I have yet to replay a game so not owning it is not a concern for me.

ButTails of iron is slower paced, and would be more comparable to hollow knight or blasphemous. It has fewer vertical elements. There is a jump but it’s mainly for interacting with the environment. The combat is tough but once you ease into it it’s very satisfying. I played on medium difficulty but easy will be a little tricky at first tooIt’s a little simple/bare-bones. There’s not much build variety but the art style is incredibly charming and the level design is solid. The story has a few twists here and there but it’s pretty much linear. It’s not the deepest but it does what it’s supposed to do and it does it very well in my opinion"

They basically added the haptics and they took advantage of the assets they had from TLOU2. It looks a bit more impressive, but the remastered version looked really good already. I don't know how to describe it, but the difference for me at least isn't that significant, and basically becomes unnoticeable since you won't be constantly focusing on it during gameplay. It's one of those instances of ""that's exactly how I remember it looking already, what's the difference?""

They never said that these games' full versions are included in the catalog. Read again, it literally says ""Discover new favorites, relive classics, and TRIAL new blockbusters"". So they did not falsely advertise. It's absolutely correct from their side. Those pictures were obviously picked because they draw the most attention to customers. But they never said once that those games are actually included as a full game, they're included as trials. And that's simple marketing. They picked a few of their best games to put them on the cover that's it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16hq2nc/playstation_plus_game_catalog_for_september_nier/,Evanz111,3 mo. ago,"Ooh, interesting! So I answered this question already, but for someone who wanted to get into the series in general, not minding the more dated entries.If you’re more focused on trying the newer games, then I’d say start with either Star Ocean 5 or 6. Us fans of the series really dislike 5, but as a short and fun JRPG experience it’s actually pretty good, it just pales in comparison to the other games and doesn’t really hit the same beats that the franchise is known for.Star Ocean 6 is the most modern feeling one, and it’s a much better game, however it’s not the best representation of what Star Oceaniswith how much more action-y it is.Both those games do pretty well as far as modern JRPGs go, and then if you enjoy them enough, you could consider revisiting the older games!For comparison, here is my answer for someone who wanted to get into the series in general, without the preference for the more recent entries:“Star Ocean First Departure would be a great starting point to the series, it sets up a lot of the fundamentals.Star Ocean 3 has the best gameplay in my opinion and value, with some of the most comprehensive post-game content in an RPG. It has a divided reputation, but it’s one of my favourite games of all time, no pun intended.Star Ocean 4 has the majority of Star Ocean fans saying the combat clicks the most with them. It’s a pretty great game but has some very strange animation work & voice acting that hasn’t aged well.Star Ocean 5 is the orphan of the series who nobody wants to acknowledge. I’ve played it through 100% 3 times now, but that’s only because you can beat the game in 12 hours (compared to the 100+ hours of SO3). Very flashy and gorgeous, but shallow as a puddle.Star Ocean 6 was an impressive return to form, but leans very heavily into the action combat and loses a lot of the slower more deliberate fighting from earlier games. However to compensate: it has the best exploration by far, giving you loads of tools to explore the environments.Personally I’d recommend this order: SO1 -> SO3 -> SO4 -> SO6 -> SO5. If you lose interest, then don’t mind skipping those last few games.”"

Can get first departure R as cheap as 6.99-9.99. Same for Til the end of time (careful though. That game is extremely buggy in the built in emulator they use for it. It'll regularly crash.) Last hope also drops to as low as 9.99. Integrity and Faithlesness also hits around the same. But it's also been spotted as high as 19.99.With all of these being purchased outright over paying for the sub, there's no need to worry about validation check ins to ensure the software will run, and they're not susceptible to being removed from a month to month service, because even if it was delisted, you can still redownload them as long as the store is up.I just still can't see the reasoning of paying for the premium hike when many of this games are merely HD remastered titles, most of which are usually sold individually on deep discount sales, or just run on a built in emulator like Legend of Dragoon does, for example.I wish they'd add more difficult to get titles like Lunar 1 and 2, Legend of Legaia, Vandal Hearts, Ehrgeiz, Einhander, or Alundra. Even the Drakengard games would be nice so they can be played by fans of the Nier series, so they can get the full story.

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/16hq2nc/playstation_plus_game_catalog_for_september_nier/,Althalos,4 mo. ago,"13 Sentinels is about 30-40 hours, depends on the player.Dragon's Crown is a Beat 'em up with a D&D theme that also has a diabloish loot system and multiple difficulties to go through, which then ends with an endless tower. So infinity if you want it to last that long.But a normal run through the regular difficulty just doing every stage once would be about 10-15 hours depending on your character and doing stages again for side quests.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itt1S_V648U"

They could easily run an emulator on the system to read the data and make it usable to the hardware on the system but it was more profitable to make people pay for premium and give them a sub par service than (god forbid) let the customers play the games they already purchased. Someone smarter than me explained the whole thing in detail and it's just a shame.

THey can make ps3 games back compatible natively, they just dont want to. Cause they can make more money remastering those games instead. But when the Transformers Cybertron games get added to Gamepass along with possibly they old Activistion Spider-Man games itll be interesting to see how they respond because I doubt they’d get remasters of those now that MS owns ABK and with steaming being the only option for those titles on PS5 Xbox would instantly gain some retroactive exclusives thanks to backward compatibility"

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1688f54/wonder_what_hes_implying/,ahnariprellik,4 mo. ago,Well to answer your question the first price increase they ever did for Gamepass added EA Access to the service and some other features and it stayed at a solid $15 a month for quite a while or $1 if you knew if you knew how to finagle that particular promo. And there is a stark difference between an increase of a few dollars and an increase of $35% across the board.

If Sony is gonna validate the price increase, here is what I think they will do. 100% speculation.Essential: Adding Crunchyroll. Dollarwise, this won't cover the increase, but if we assume they are ultimately increasing prices to increase margins, not everything will be one to one on increase.Extra: The promise of more titles. I think this might be done by solidifying the Ubisoft+ Classics into just Ubisoft+ Basic. In that, I can see all Ubisoft games being available on Extra, but without the DLC that you get with Ubisoft+. However, the cost increase would more than cover Sony just paying Ubisoft everyones monthly fee.Premium: Gonna disappoint on this one, but it's cloud gaming. They will launch 4K cloud streaming for PS5 games but also start allowing Premium members to start streaming games they own not included in Premium yet, starting with select titles and the promise that all future releases from third parties will offer a cloud version (not just first party)."

It does suck how they threw Redfall devs under the bus, even though you could say it wasn’ttechnicallytheir fault (since the game was in development before they acquired them), but if you want to build up solid studios and make quality games you have to show you care,truly care, instead of come off as a money-hungry boss who is interested in results only.I’m glad you brought it up cause it shows a great juxtaposition between Sony and Microsoft’s management. For instance, 1 billion of Sony’s 3 billion purchase of Bungie went directly towards retaining talent, whereas Microsoft buys Bethesda and 343 studios and the only result is the complete destruction of Halo’s reputation and a broken launch in Redfall with no word on fixing either issue from Microsoft."

At first I didn’t like Death’s Door because I was comparing it too harshly with Tunic, but once I saw it for what it was and played it as it’s own unique game objectively, I fell in love."

Tunic is definitely harder, but I enjoyed the challenge. The entire game is in another language, one that the developers created specifically for the game. That in itself makes the game much more challenging because you’re forced to use context clues and connect the pieces together to understand the lore and what to do next.The entire game plays a lot like Dark Souls 1 in terms of progression, you’re wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out your next move, the game doesn’t hold your hand at all with an objective marker or minimap or anything like that. That being said, I highly recommend Tunic to anyone who enjoys a challenge, especially retro gamers who grew up playing TLOZ (it’s basically a love letter to Zelda in a way)"

The puzzles are much more complicated in tunic, deaths door has pretty simple & easy to figure out puzzles. The leveling up system in tunic revolves around finding well-hidden key items whereas in deaths door it’s just farming XP then cashing in to increase your desired stat."

My experience with video game basketball basically jumped from NBA Jam on the SNES, to NCAA Final Four 2000 on the PS1, to NBA Live 2009 on the PS3, and then NBA2K20 and NBA2K23 on the PS4 via PS+. The people that buy NBA 2K every year (or Madden, or FIFA, etc.) are the die hard fans. The vast majority of people buy more infrequently than that, so getting an upgraded title for a new console is nice to have (NBA2K20 was only PS4, while NBA2K23 has a PS5 version).Same thing with a bunch of other sports games. I like hockey, but I haven't played a hockey video game since NHL 2003 on the PS2. If an NHL game were announced as a monthly PS+ title next month, I'd be pretty happy with the selection."

I was wondering why a lot of these scores are lower than what you would find compared to other aggregate sites.  Listing critic and user scores separately is fine, but combining them to one score doesn't seem too helpful imo.Not saying that the year hasn't been disappointing overall when it comes to monthly games, but using this site's sketchy aggregate scores isn't a good way to make that point.And for anyone who dislikes metecritic's scoring, this metagameguide site also uses weighted averages with how all of it is weighted hidden from the public so it's not even any better in that regard."

Also, the combining of critic and user scores into one score is an odd choice imo.Plus I don't think these scores matter too much.

It's not Metacritic, it's another site called MetaGame.Guide which supposedly uses their own secret weighted aggregate scoring system.I was looking into this site a bit more by checking some of the games and I have no idea where they are pulling these critic or user scores from.  Unless I'm missing something, on the site they post the combined score(used in the OP), a critic score, and a user score.  What's different about this site is they don't break down where any of it comes from at all.  With sites like metacritic or Opencritic, I can at least see all the individual critic scores that go into that score but with this site, we have no idea what critics or how many critics.And the user score is odd too because the site doesn't appear to have its own user scoring system, say like metacritic, but instead uses, as according to its FAQ, ""all user scores we can find"".So at least with other aggregate sites, for all their faults, you can at least see where the numbers are coming from even if we might not know how it's all weighted.

I've never played it (and actually wasn't a huge fan of Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas in the PS3 era), but I otherwise thought Fallout was a huge franchise with a lot of effort put into it. Looking at the list, that's probably the biggest AAA game given out all year, but it's also the lowest rated by a fairly large margin. What gives? Is this one of those games that was fundamentally broken at launch resulting in low review scores, but it got better over time with patches (e.g., like Cyberpunk 2077)?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/188ff7p/score_of_2023_ps_plus_essential_games/,DrunkeNinja,1 mo. ago,"Fallout 76 launched in a bad state and review scores at the time reflect that.  The game has had a lot of big fixes and free updates since then so the state it is now doesn't really reflect the state it was in at launch.I personally started playing the game when they had the big Wastelanders update and I liked the game a lot.  They have since added even more content and QoL fixes to the game so I think the game has improved even since I started playing it.  I don't play it any longer, after a while it's just a never ending grind for gear with slightly better numbers, but a lot of the story missions are well done and I had hundreds of hours of fun so it was worth the $5 I spent on the game disc.A lack of content and lots of bugs will bring a score down though and Fallout 76 deserved the scores it got at the time but I do think the devs have improved the game a lot so its worth checking out for those that liked Fallout 4.  Live service games can get better over time, though it doesn't excuse pushing out a game with too little content at launch."

If I only paid for essential and that’s all I got for the year would it be worth it? That’s pretty subjective so hard to say. Most of those I played you can probably find on sale so might be able to get them for less than the subscription. Ultimately that’s why I do pay for the deluxe (I use mostly the extra catalogue but they make the price difference so close that if I get one or two games from classics then it feels worth it) because if I didn’t have the catalogue I’m not sure if the value would quite be there."

It's literally just a worse way to play them than plugging in my old PS3. The game trials are nice, but few and far between. And the rest of the classics catalogue is massively lacking, a handful of old games getting trophy support really doesn't seem worth the entry price.The ironic thing is I have premium since I got grandfathered in from PSNow at £50 a year, I'd decided to try it out the month before they made the switch which ended up being the best decision, but I don't think I've actually made use of any of the premium offerings since."

No native downloads for old games, 30fps and any good PS3 game Sony had a good online following for has no online servers, which is really odd, just the campaigns.It’s the worst service for its price point, and now that’s increasing.  For a market share leader, I’d expect better.Perhaps this will change at State of Play, but I doubt it, it’s been 2 generations of PlayStation and Sonys last online competitive FPS was Killzone Shadowfall (2013).and as far as we know all they’re working on is Factions.  Which again is coming out who knows when.It’s really a side of PlayStation Sony has neglected when they didn’t have too.  For far far to long.The only way this price increase might be justified rationally for most people is if they released PS1, PS2, PS3 and PS4 games backwards compatible and native download with 60fps boosts, resolution bump and HDR perhaps.Because Xbox has that for its console, so something similar would be good.  Honestly even services like GeForce Shield are better.I’ve said this for years, it’s such a stark obvious and glaring issue, yet only now after them increasing the price are people beginning to talk about it, which makes me doubt Sonys retention rates, I don’t think PS has a large retention rate nor online presence in its user base which is ironically the largest user base.I don't and never will understand Sony and its fan base minority who speak out, have against online quality experiences.  Its the elephant in the room ignored for 2 generations now.Also paying for cloud saves is so weird, on Xbox it’s free.  You don’t need a sub."

If you were a PS+ user, it would literally be in your best interest to condemn the bad things about PS+ (like the price hike or the poor value of the Premium/Deluxe tiers) and praise the good things about Game Pass (like the major Day 1 releases from first and third parties).

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/17ueprt/ps_store_black_friday_includes_discounts_on/,Unkechaug,2 mo. ago,"I think they closed most loopholes but not 100% sure. It depends if you are a current subscriber and what tier. If you already have Extra or Premium, you are almost certainly locked out of any good discount. Otherwise you may have options.If your sub is ending or if you have Essential, you might be able to add additional years at the promotional prices. If you have multiple years stacked up you can check to see how much it would be to upgrade to a higher tier. It used to be upgrading to Extra was capped at $100 and Premium at $150 no matter how many years. That’s how I did it - buy PSN cards, add to wallet. Then buy the discounted Essential sub multiple times. Then pay one final price to upgrade your entire stacked membership for all the years at once. That last part is key because if they removed the upgrade cap then getting Extra or Premium could be much much more expensive."

There are so many games coming out every year it's impossible to play them all, even one of these services provides more than you can ever keep up with but for my money (I'm subbed to both, and HB Choice) PS+ has been a way more worthwhile experience. Also, I'm comparing two billion dollar company's services, I'm not defending either. Just saying PS+ Extra and XBGP are literally the same price, PS+ Premium is like 5 less than XBGP Gold so I'm not sure why people here consider the price so ridiculous.

Not even at the price before the new one.I am not under any circumstances going to re-subscribe to the Premium tier. I bought a Digital Edition PS5 to use with Extra/Premium specifically around the time they released the new subscription. Do you think I can get them to remove the free month? Because otherwise I'm selling the PS5. I refuse to be robbed like this. I didn't ask for the free month that's just going to end up costing me more.

It’s the kind of game that will excel if its free because it gives people the chance to dip in and out without needing to commit.If you’re the type of player who like to buzz out, maybe get a little high and dig into the weird minds of players all over the world, there’s no better product than Dreams for that. It’s like Netflix for creativity — the things some people come up with are truly mesmerizing. It’s also really robust if you wanted to create; just be ready to do plenty of tutorials because Dreams is basically a full software suite with animation tools, audio tools and a game engine all in one. Ironically, games are the least appealing things on the dreamverse — I prefer the weird one-off experiences and art/music people make."

Once I reached endgame in pre season, I felt emptiness on the inside, and then the same thing happened in season 1.

Not really. The latest expansion which was supposed to hype us fans up even more was terrible to the point that people are genuinely worried Bungie isn't going to deliver a satisfying conclusion. And I'm specifically referring to existing fans, new player experience is non-existent because the game doesn't really tell you what to do, nor can you even understand the plot without Youtube because most of D2's story is deleted from the game. Not to mention lately it has become apparent that not even Bungie themselves care about the game very much. Not going to detail how, I'll just say that their GDC talks, this ongoing year, and the latest State Of The Game don't paint a bright future at all."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/10mf0t8/just_bought_a_ps_extra_subscription_for_the_first/,Gofein,11 mo. ago,Well google sides with you and that’s fine but the store still says I already own the game so I can’t purchase it on its own for any price. Might have also been nice if the store made it clearer how long I had to finish a 100+ hour game upfront because this kinda looks like a scummy attempt to get players invested in a game for 6 months (June to December if acv was in the catalogue day 1) and then make them pay for the game a second time but that has of course backfired because I still can’t buy the gameEdit: do you guys need screenshots?cause I got screenshots.it’s still being used to promote Extra. It still appears in the catalog. It’s still telling me to fuck off

You get these shitty little nft things and can display a few in a trophy cabinet only accessible through the app.However they have some that reward coins, and purchasing games also rewards coins. Coins can be traded for games or ps credit. I've made £15 so far so it's definitely worth doing the monthly coin ones because 2/3 of those center on booting up a ps+ (1 essential and 1 extra) games. Those 2 will reward 50 coins each. You get a lot more for purchasing games. For, iirc, 1250 you get £5."

Had a lot of years without anything gaming wise due to the above circumstance leaving me very much a poor lol. The PS5 is actually my newest toy and first console since the PS4 for a few months 9 years ago. I still have a whopping PC backlog, plenty to try and do on PS Plus and 10 months to go on the sub so we'll see how it goes (paid for itself already tbh) But my cup runneth over for now.The one hope I do have is that 20 years from now I remain half as into it as you are.

Love the choices and horrible deaths. Eerie. You should check out the entire Dark Pictures Anthology I guess. Great stuff.Vampyr could have improved on the combat and gameplay. It was successful in making me feel unsafe venturing into the night. Really atmospheric and creepy London in the 1800s. The story line also could have been narrated better. I mean after a while I was a little lost about where to go next, and why we were going there cause I was distracted by that one gang/monster around a bridge en route, forcing me to restart the level again and again. But sure I love the idea of playing as a doctor vampire with questionable morals.Days Gone would freak me once it was nighttime. Great sound design, graphics and gameplay. Having the chance of being stranded if you didn't have enough fuel freaked me out go on endless freeroams, as it would if it was the real world. I felt the weakest point was the storytelling.Plague tale has great graphics, story and gameplay mechanics. Would recommend. But I would not say it is a horror game, unless you're horrified by rats.Alien Isolation, though not on the list, is by far my favourite horror game."

Ya the PS5 looks better it's true 4k vs the 4pro checkerboard 4k and has more stable 60 FPS.  Ray tracing (if the game supports it) and load time are the biggest differences in my opinion."

I haven't really seen a huge jump in PS5 vs PS4 (especially the pro) .I respectfully disagree. Sony wouldn't have put a powerful GPU in the PS5 if graphics have hit a wall or hit a plateau at this point. We haven't even seen the entire power of the PS5 as of yet especially since many games are still being sent out as cross-gen which limits the developer from maximizing the PS5's capabilities.

Dandara is more unique with its approach, so if you would be picking between these two, I'd recommend Dandara.Ace of Seafood if you enjoy completely bizzare things and have a very high tolerance for jank. You play as various sea creatures and you shoot other sea creatures. It's a lot of fun, but very bizarre.My time at Portia is a really nice game if you enjoy things like Stardew Valley, but it's very time consuming and might be better bought instead so that you don't have to rush to finish things. It's dirt cheap when discounted on the PS Store.Edit: Overall though, I wouldn't put the highest priority to any of these games.

(I don’t have it)No. That's what the Xbox fanboys want people to think. Even the PS Plus Essential tier gives monthly free games that are never taken away. Nothing like that is on GP. PS Plus has well over twice the amount of games over GP and in order to have multiplayer capability you have to buy the top tier GP Ultimate when PS Plus Essential offers it. To top that off PS Plus is far cheaper than GP and there are far more AAA 1st party titles on PS Plus.GP's Day 1 releases are something customers cannot even rely on as that's something customer's have to wait for and there's no guarantee they will like what gets released so the advertisement for it is more hype than reality.

I miss those days.Yes, I have the most prestine nostalgia glasses for this, but I also had this on my PS3 and Vita back in the day and enjoyed it then too. Super stoked to finally be able to enjoy this absolute classic again. You took long enough, Sony."

Even though Kiwami is the remake of the first game, it’s recommended you start from 0 which was a prequel to it. So 0- kiwami then 2-6. Then like a dragon is after 6, but it has a new protagonist and new gameplay style so it’s kind of intended as a sequel but also accessible to newcomers. If you’re genuinely interested in the series though, I’d try out yakuza 0! It’s a complete story on its own and it’s one of the best in the series too. It’s not on extra but I’ve seen it go for as low as €6 on the ps storeedit: sega seems to be very cosy with Microsoft recently and all their games are debuting on gamepass, and is probably why the yakuzas have been leaving the sony service the past few months.

Moreover they keep ignoring existing subscribers, no renawal discounted offers up to now after the new prices (at least for me, I’m a Premium user). Consider that in one year I already played and finished the best games from the catalogue, so they should give me a very good reason to keep paying the highest tier. Instead they want more money, gives me no renawal discount and put worse games. I call it suicide marketing, it seems they want existing high tiers subscribers to leave or downgrade, as I’ll do if I don’t get any discount within the end of January."

The release the put out said something along the lines of ""in order to continue to bring you the same great service."" No improvements suggested though.Renewal for existing customers were offered on black Friday and currently however your current subscription must be stated to end before that time period. They did removed the ability to stack which sucks but I'm not mad about it.I don't fault anyone for not seeing the value in it anymore. I just fault them if they jack these decisions based on bad information or illogical conclusions.I paid 108.51 after tax for premium renewal this year during black Friday, with combining gift card discounts from Target. That comes out to less than $10/mo. I can't think of a single thing I pay $10/mo for that brings me more value personally.

So was it a RNG marketing? Best way to make me angry. Improvement or not, they did not even keep the same quality, as I told you, let’s see tomorrow line-up for higher tiers, it can’t be worse than November anyway. And again, an existing subscriber logically already played a lot of the catalogue, we talk about games here, so they should give a renewal discount to keep him in the highest tier. Why should I pay more when I get less and I already played Returnal, Demon’s Souls, HFW, Ghostwire etc? But ok, if they only think about getting new subs, like phone/internet providers policies, no problem. I will downgrade since I also buy tons of games.

The price hike is quite steep, with several news outlets pointing that out (not necessarily hating or justifying).A lot of things can happen next year. Whether they go Netflix like the other guy said and increase their profits with this move, or maybe have the opposite effect where animosity towards Sony goes out of control and/or value proposition does not justify the price which leads to even less subs.TBH, the price increase does hurt for me to the point that I am considering not renewing. I do have disposable money to throw at the new yearly price, but I just can't wholeheartedly get behind it on principle.

For these folks, cracking down on piracy will not always turn them into paying customers.There is a hint of truth in what you say though.

And I subscribed to two years of game pass ultimate for what worked out to five dollars a month.I’m gonna keep those PlayStation gift cards in my account, and I’m just gonna use them in the future to buy whatever first party exclusive game I want to buy.As far as gaming subscription plans, I’m only going to keep one in my household, and that’s for Xbox. Game pass is such a better deal and you get the biggest titles day one.My PlayStation may be sitting a little lonely until Final Fantasy 7 rebirth comes out."

I had PS Plus (now called Essential) for about five years, and I let it lapse a few weeks ago.I’m not really playing that many online games, and the “free” monthly games have noticeably gone down in quality.I think I’ll just take a break for a few months, the value proposition just isn’t there. I might reconsider if I get bored of my backlog, or if they release some amazing monthly game that I feel like I must get.Otherwise, I just see no point. I have better things to spend €70 on.(Also, locking already downloaded and installed PS+ games for expired subscribers is a dickhead move. I thought you only lost access to your library. But no.)"

And, while I don't currently own an Xbox, I was  an avid Xbox 360 gamer before switching to the PS4 (and that was mainly because of Microsoft's dumb decision to try and force the Kinect on everyone), so could easily see myself switching back to Xbox, especially with the new Xbox model expected to come out next year."

https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18g201x/ps_plus_is_back_on_offer_from_today_until_18th/,Wicked-Death,19 days ago,So do they want people with Premium and Extra to just not stay with the service? At this point I’m going to let my plus run out and wait for one of these deals since it’s only for non-current Extra/Premium members. What bullshit. 😆

Right now you don't have an active membership and you still are NOT getting offered a discount for essential? But you had a discount on black Friday when it was active?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18g201x/ps_plus_is_back_on_offer_from_today_until_18th/,Nirast25,19 days ago,I think Essential is simply not being discounted at all.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18g201x/ps_plus_is_back_on_offer_from_today_until_18th/,Unusual_Trade5917,19 days ago,I was also waiting for the discount on Essential. And yes there is absolutely no discount on Essential. So disappointed that after a 20$ price increase they can't even offer a discount on it.

It makes a mess of your library... what games you own, what are in each sub, which are on disc or ps store licenses.Meh... I will get essential when elden ring dlc comes out. I just need online for souls... should be free honestly"

I have over 2k platinums on my accounts but these prices will be the reason why I stop my loyalty& subscription to Playstation for the 1st time in the past 20years"
https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/18g201x/ps_plus_is_back_on_offer_from_today_until_18th/,jakkaroo,18 days ago,Don't ask me how but I'm paying 79.99/year for PS Plus Premium. I got rolled over from my old PS Now account. Anyone else getting this?
