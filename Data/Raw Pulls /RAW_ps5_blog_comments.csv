2,xDD90x,"December 20, 2023 at 1:35 pm PST","The gameplay looks fun and I have faith in Rocksteady to deliver a good game with a good story, but I just have no interest in the Suicide Squad. It‚Äôs the same reason I didn‚Äôt play Gotham Knights. Those characters just don‚Äôt have the same appeal as Spider-Man, Batman, and Superman. I would bet the idea for this game immerged from an early attempt to conceptualize a Superman game. Faced with all the challenges developing a game where you play as a near-invincible character would entail, someone likely hatched the idea that Superman would make for a better boss character than a player character, and so the concept of SSKTJ was born. It‚Äôs shocking that it‚Äôs been 17 years since a Superman game was released. I still believe a good Superman game could be achieved with enough ingenuity and ambition.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/12/20/how-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-loadout-options-enable-customizable-chaos/

4,unknownfa,"December 21, 2023 at 9:07 pm PST","SMH, they are trying so hard to market this game. Rocksteady, What an incredible talented team making a game like this üò¢. I hate WB games for making rocksteady to design and build a LS game. They could have potentially make an amazing superhero games like spider man series or Batman series. I‚Äôm sure story will be amazing since Rock Steady is involved,but the gameplay mechanics are extremely disappointing. No enemy variety and the whole game is pretty much shooting purple Aliens to lvl up your character. For some strange reason, all aliens looks the same. Another disappointment just like Avengers. Waste of resources, money, and talents that could have been used elsewhere. This is pretty much obvious WB game publisher and investors forced Rock Steady to make an ongoing live service with season passes to get money from the players. I hope Rocksteady the best , but my feeling says this game will not be performing well in terms of sales and will not have the support of major gaming community.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/12/20/how-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-loadout-options-enable-customizable-chaos/

I know I have posted negative comments before, and I don‚Äôt mean to be negative and rude, but I really am just disappointed and sad that one of my favorite studios has turned into a shell of themselves.  No new game announcements, no actual new IP, and a cancelled project, that not only looked promising and fun, but it was promised as a part of TLOU2.  Instead, all you have done is port your games from PS4 to PS5 with little reason to re-buy them.  What are you doing?  How can the best PS Studio fall so hard.  You don‚Äôt have to release ‚Äúperfect games‚Äù.  You CAN release fun games at a higher rate.  Look at Fromsoft.  They are proof the games industry doesn‚Äôt need 10 year development cycles to make great games at a fast pace.  I just feel let down by Naughty Dog, and especially Playstation Studios this gen.  Where are the games!  Where are the new IP?",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/12/05/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-exploring-the-roguelike-survival-mode-no-return/

331,ModTheMod14,"November 16, 2023 at 4:43 am PST","The discussion has become much bigger than this game or Rocksteady for us gamers. It is about WB (and other companies in the industry) openly and shamelessly trying to force service game after service game down our throat, where not FUN or an AWESOME GAMING EXPERIENCE are leading game-development and decision-making but MONETIZATION, PLAYER RETENTION, FEAR OF ‚ÄúOVERDELIVERY‚Äù and other corporate buzzwords and behavioral psychology tricks, and it plainly and wholeheartedly just sucks!The ONLY language those corporates understand is MONEY, therefore a service-game like Suicide Squad, which asks a full premium price AND THEN more and more and more money through battle passes, skins and whatnot, should just not be supported by gamers. Look at Marvels Spider-Man 2, a game by Insomniac, a passionate single player oriented studio focused on delivering awesome experiences: they made a banger game, GOTY contender, where you also could unlock like 99% (without Deluxe Edition content) of cosmetics THROUGH GAMEPLAY, NOT GAMEPAY, and thats how it should be and should be honoured with our money: a premium price for a premium product! If YOU support Suicide Squad and ohter games like this, make no mistake: you are hurting yourself as a gamer, because the industry as a whole will move into a direction, where pretty much every game coming out will be an ALWAYS-ONLINE LOOTER SHOOTER FORTNITE CLONE with dumbed down gameplay and cut content, because they are selling it to you later. Please dont let them get away with this, Im begging you on behalf of gaming as the thought.provoking, creative, multifacetted and interactive medium we all love and enjoy (and btw: are also more than willing to pay for, just give us premium single player games, for gods sake, and bath in money!).",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/11/15/how-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-taps-into-ps5s-immersive-power/

I‚Äôm sure some people are going to say that the physical games are buggy, incomplete, or intentionally unplayable, but there are still a few new releases that do ship out in a solid state.If anyone wants to ignore this issue and defend Sony or some random law making the appalling decisions, that‚Äôs fine. At this point, I am pretty much done with PlayStation and I am already considering moving to a PC since the world is moving towards a digital only future.Also, it has been confirmed today that the disc drive unregisters with the system during the factory reset process. The original large PS5 model never had this problem and this one should never have it in the first place. If GT7‚Äôs 48 hour server outage wasn‚Äôt enough to convince the developers to remove the always online requirement for the single player career mode and other local play features, I don‚Äôt think Sony would care enough to remove the online activation for the PS5 slim‚Äôs disc drive since it doesn‚Äôt get enough backlash.

Just design the hardware without any complex software barriers. All you have to do is attach the hardware, plug and play the system, simple as that. It shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult.

I‚Äôm not trying to strike a nerve on some people reading the comments to believe I‚Äôm attacking Sony on something that I personally felt like what they are doing is wrong.

Maybe what Sony should‚Äôve done instead is have that activation system built in the system‚Äôs software instead to verify if the disc drive is legit or not. Anything that‚Äôs not legit could block the system off from PlayStation Network services as well. They could also use a proprietary connection for the hardware although I am not sure what type of connection the disc drive uses. Look, I love PlayStation, and I‚Äôve been playing with their hardware for over 20 years now. I would never support or promote piracy in anyway and the game developers that pour their hearts and souls into the games they make deserve credit and respect for what they do. I‚Äôm really disappointed with the way Sony designed the PS5 slim by making the disc drive inactive without requiring activation that‚Äôs being held captive on a server. This could all change with a software update later on, but it may never happen. I know physical media is already looking to be phased out soon, and that‚Äôs why I wanted to call out on Sony to make changes on how a detachable disc drive should be set up. I know the online server method isn‚Äôt a bad idea right now, but with all due respect, it would be really difficult going back to play physical copies of some of the PS5 games that are completed on disc in the next few decades once Sony decides to shut the servers down. The disc drive would have to be activated again if the system goes through a factory reset, a restore process, and other system related maintenance.

It should be shaped either like a PS One or PS2 console, as a separate stand-alone unit Sony should manufacture CD laser capabilities in those PlayStation Media player with the ability to read and play any PS1 games and PS2 games. Just having a PlayStation Media player that can transfer physical games from PS4/PS5/PS6, that could play PS1/PS2 and hopefully PS3.That it can rip CDs and play Movies. Which such a device, it could last forever for PS6/PS7/PS8 etc.It would drive down the cost of the system by buying a separate device. There will be new iterations of the models but will be forward compatible and backward compatible. I GREATLY miss the days of having music on my PlayStation.My PS3 still have a lot of usage just to transfer Music CD and rip them. Yes, I did ask you to make an add-on Years ago like you just did and you listened to me. Yay. I did not have this idea back then but I have it now, I‚Äôm sure many will love this new idea. However, keep making PS consoles with disc models, this rather is both for a media player, a backwards compatible console and can transfer over disc based games to the new digital PS console.

Guerrilla made adjustments in traversal (flying, climbing mechanics) and melee combat between HZD and HFW ‚Äì in no small part due to audience expectations based on industry trends ‚Äì and the idea of even limited agency over romance remains extremely popular (not just historically in the Witcher series or Mass Effect, but also recently with Baldur‚Äôs Gate).

It‚Äôs a UX design disaster.

I‚Äôve been meaning to play it for years but this specific game isn‚Äôt on the catalog nor is it available physically for PS4/PS5. I might bite for $20 but being digital only still hurts because I have so many other games on my backlog, service games to play as well as storage size on my PS5 to maintain (thanks for 667 GB btw) Because of PS Stars, I tried out Gran Turismo 7 and many other games from my library and for the first time since GT5 and I was absolutely floored by it. Despite what die-hards say, it‚Äôs a really fun game through and through! A relaxing rollercoaster ride with the right camera HUD. It‚Äôs so addicting that I‚Äôm actually thinking about picking it up on PS Direct‚Äôs Black Friday sale so I can own it from the comfort of my shelf. I like how PS Stars highlights existing and upcoming games! It‚Äôs great‚Ä¶ but having them on the catalog would also help.

First, native Linux support for steam os please to help boost performance further. Second, as much as I enjoyed the first. I was underwhelmed by the ham fisted story telling of this game and nonsensical virtue signaling of its DE&I directives. Especially in the DLC. I‚Äôm saying this as someone with CE for both games, a big ass thunder jaw, a fricken Lego set, physical sound tracks, and a big ol canvas painting of alloy in from the first game in his game room. Stop it. Either make these scenarios make sense and less like happy day dream fanfiction or move on. That isn‚Äôt even getting into alloy stopping more frequently than Yuna to defeat Syn when she is clearly in a rush. Don‚Äôt think gameplay is without criticism here either. For every improvement there was a step back. No gradual escalation to help get the player involved in crafting, some how this went from something you embrace at the start to almost an end game exclusive activity. The hunt seemed less relevant then in the first game. Which is weird since it is less involved.

It‚Äôs insanely fun and addicting, just like Splatoon, but with it‚Äôs own twist. The graphics are bright, colorful and pop out with the resolution quality. Each person has their own abilities and ultimate that rarely do much so you‚Äôll have to rely on your own personal weapon shots. You foam the ground, causing you to build walls that you can climb for higher ground while moving around on a foam board for a quick exit or chase. Foaming the area isn‚Äôt mandatory too! Some characters and game modes need some more tuning. The MVP style battles are SUPER fun‚Ä¶ but the Elimination round style of battles finish quicker than the actual queue for them.

1610,Door_to_Light_95,"September 13, 2023 at 11:56 am PDT","Spyro on the original PS1 was one of the first games I ever played. As such, the series is incredibly special to me. This article was a great read, and I enjoyed reading the remarks and comments of both the Insomniac and Toys for Bob staff. I also absolutely loved how Toys for Bob remastered the original three Spyro games. I‚Äôm so incredibly thankful that they put so much care and effort into making sure the remastered versions were so faithful to the originals. It was such a wonderful experience replaying through these games I experienced as a kid, and having just as much fun doing so. One thing I have always found special about Spyro (and one of its biggest advantages) is that you get to play as a dragon for crying out loud! Even to this day, there‚Äôs not many games where you play as a dragon. Spyro has always been special because of that. And of course, it‚Äôs fun and appealing gameplay, charming and entertaining characters, incredible music, and how well it manages to succeed in giving that collectathon vibe that 3D platformers are known for. Happy 25th anniversary, Spyro! (As a side note, I know Activision is getting closer and closer to being bought by Microsoft. I know the likes of Spyro and Crash Bandicoot aren‚Äôt as huge of games as Call of Duty, but I still hope that as Microsoft has said Call of Duty will remain multiplatform, that the likes of Spyro can as well. I‚Äôm okay with Microsoft owning Activision, and I honestly think my two childhood friends, Spyro and Crash Bandicoot, are in much safer hands being owned by Microsoft than just Activision in its current state. Activision has been having a lot of internal difficulties in recent years, and I think Spyro and Crash are in a safer home with Microsoft if the deal goes through. That being said, I sincerely hope that Spyro and Crash can still be multiplatform games ‚Äî especially if we get new Spyro and Crash games going forward. Having them at least available on PlayStation would be wonderful, considering the significant history that Spyro and Crash have with PlayStation. I‚Äôm totally all for Spyro and Crash being played by more people, across all platforms. I just hope that PlayStation gamers can still have access to potential new Spyro and Crash games in the future too. Regardless, though, happy 25th anniversary Spyro! I hope to see you star in a new game soon, and I am forever thankful for all the memories I cherish with you throughout the years!)",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/13/spyro-at-25-insomniac-games-and-toys-for-bob-celebrate-25-years-of-spyro-the-dragon/

For me, there was never any stress or cause for concern with Spyro games (unless you were trying to get a platinum trophy with the Reignited Trilogy and defeat Ripto without getting hurt once). Each day, I could just relax, explore, and collect things. I don‚Äôt think that there could be a better gaming experience than that (although, I do realize that this is just my opinion). It was quite soothing. Everything about the games was phenomenal, but I was most impressed by the music. I found and downloaded the soundtrack for all of the games online 11 years ago or so, and I still listen to those songs to this day. Stewart Copeland did an amazing job composing the music for this series! I‚Äôve heard rumors that a new Spyro game might be in development, and I recall seeing a few Spyro Easter eggs in Crash Bandicoot 4. While I hope that a new Spyro game is in development, whether or not that is the case, I will also be a huge fan of Spyro for the games that he has already starred in. To everyone that had a hand in creating the Spyro Trilogy (and Reignited Trilogy), I thank you.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/13/spyro-at-25-insomniac-games-and-toys-for-bob-celebrate-25-years-of-spyro-the-dragon/

1676,mountain_spider,"September 13, 2023 at 10:48 am PDT","It‚Äôs letting the receiver take over and process the information. Why would you want to set up and use your physical controller for TV 3-D audio when anybody that has Atmos or any 3-D system like DTSX already is fine tuned internally with a microphone for the room, which is more accurate than recording from a handheld controller. In other words, the system is just tossing the audio over to your receiver, if you did any room measurements with the microphone, you‚Äôre done and ready to go and it will automatically know how many extra speakers you have beyond 5.1 or 7.2 like if you have a 5.1 with Dolby 3-D speaker 5.1.2 etc. It‚Äôs far more accurate. The reason you had to do a test measurement with your controller to the TV speakers is because it‚Äôs only using two channel sound simulating three-dimensional audio from two speakers. However, now it‚Äôs just tossing the audio and whatever your system is already set up with uses it.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/13/ps5-update-rolls-out-globally-with-new-accessibility-audio-and-social-feature-enhancements/

This new option basically repackages the 3D Audio information in an Atmos container for your AVR to sort out. The good news is that games with 3D Audio support will sound their best on a well configured Atmos capable system. The bad news is that upmixing via Dolby Upmixer, Auro3D or DTS:X is no longer possible because the sound from the PS5 is forced into an Atmos container, so the AVR thinks there‚Äôs nothing to upmix even if the stream only contains 5.1 audio in reality.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/13/ps5-update-rolls-out-globally-with-new-accessibility-audio-and-social-feature-enhancements/

I have every PlayStation set of headphones to date, as well as some 3rd party ones, but I prefer my sound system. Home theater owners like myself have been waiting 3 years for this and so far the sound is remarkable. @Tolq, wouldn‚Äôt manually selecting Linear PCM or DTSX solve the upmixing issue?",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/13/ps5-update-rolls-out-globally-with-new-accessibility-audio-and-social-feature-enhancements/

Yes, if you know that a game doesn‚Äôt support 3D audio, you can change the audio settings on a system level to e.g. LPCM, and your AVR could then upmix it again. My point was that it is a bit clunky to do it manually on a game by game basis instead of the games themselves ‚Äútriggering‚Äù Atmos when applicable, but it is a minor downside all things considered.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/09/13/ps5-update-rolls-out-globally-with-new-accessibility-audio-and-social-feature-enhancements/

1815,Eraezr,"August 29, 2023 at 9:07 pm PDT","Feedback: Just wanted to put in my gratitude fore allowing the game VA-11 HALL-A to be unrestricted in its content, on PlayStation. The game has adult themes in a cyberpunk world and see the patrons of the bartender speak openly adds to the sense of immersion and experience. In a way it‚Äôs quite refreshing. When more video games are allowed to be this way, we don‚Äôt need topics like sex and nudity to be only comedy talking point in games in Saints Row (just to emphasize, I don‚Äôt mind SR being lewd ‚Äì that is its own niche with its own audience) which makes the medium look immature. If all publishers and studios aren‚Äôt restricted, a variety of content starts to occupy the ecosystem, bringing in nuanced and mature dialogue, which adds to gaming as a medium to have a similar if not better levity than say movies/TV in conveying ideas.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/29/how-tekken-8-harnesses-the-power-of-ps5-out-january-26-2024/

Improvements made to a game after launch is a result of work done after launch. This concept is pretty basic. Yep, we all know how the game was during that first year. But by that point the developers had begun working on the post-launch improvements. NMS launched seven years ago. Thus, it has been seven years of amazing work to reach the point the game‚Äôs at now, and it‚Äôs possible to hold both that opinion and the opinion that the game wasn‚Äôt good on release.

I know that it‚Äôs probably not the highest priority, but I think it would still be beneficial to add a few more options to offline local multiplayer. The 2 player offline multiplayer is good as it stands now, but it would still be really nice to see some updates to the local multiplayer, even though it‚Äôs not as popular as online multiplayer. One suggestion would be to allow the screen for each player in splitscreen to hide the UI and allow the game itself to fill the entirety of each player‚Äôs screen. Having that UI with all the neat stats and indicators is a nice option, but I don‚Äôt think having it as the only option for 2 player offline races is all that great. I for one, would love to play a 2 player offline race with a friend on the couch without the busy UI surrounding each player‚Äôs side of the screen. It kind of makes the area of the screen with the actual race going on rather small and more difficult to see in my opinion. It would be nice to be able to have an option for each player‚Äôs side of the screen in splitscreen to fill the entirety of the screen too, for those of us who want to play local couch races without the UI taking up so much screen space. I know this probably isn‚Äôt the highest priority, but even though online multiplayer is so big nowadays, there‚Äôs still quite a lot of people like me who also enjoy local multiplayer with friends in person too. Having some additional options added to the 2 player offline multiplayer would still be a worthwhile addition in my opinion, even though online multiplayer is the much bigger focus.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/08/04/gran-turismo-7-update-1-36-adds-4-new-cars-three-extra-menus-and-a-gran-turismo-movie-experience/

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, new tracks will be awesome and I‚Äôd even like to see the Goodwood FOS hill-climb event make a return. A SOPHY race on each track may also create a bit of incentive for single-player enthusiasts if the winning payouts are very decent.

As it stands I haven‚Äôt played in ages as I‚Äôm tired of grinding the Le Mans track over & over again just so I can buy a new car and look at it in my garage or walk around it with the VR headset.

2183,turniplord,"July 31, 2023 at 4:28 am PDT","Sounds good ‚Äì 2 questions and some suggestions‚Ä¶ Q1. will the silly 1,000 game limit be removed if we have an 8TB M.2 in the PS5? At the moment, you can‚Äôt install over 1,000 games on the external HDD (PS4 and PS5 backups), so I‚Äôm guessing the limit will also be in place on the internal drives. I have around 500 games installed on my internal 4TB M.2 but I won‚Äôt be upgrading if the limit is still there ‚Äì it‚Äôs the same silly pointless limit as the online saves for PS4 being limited to a thousand FILES. Q2. How do we apply for the BETA? I‚Äôve been chosen for the last 4 or 5 BETAs but I see no link this time ‚Äì will past people just get access to it? Suggestions:1. You NEED to enable the ability to check for updates and manage save files by pressing Options on games that are installed in the library. At the moment you have to basically cancel whatever you‚Äôre playing and start the game. Then, when it‚Äôs on the home screen, you can then do the above two operations ‚Äì this should be possible without starting the game. 2. The PS5 NEEDS to give you a warning if you‚Äôre starting a game but you have one already open. I‚Äôve accidentally closed games so many times, losing progress and even corrupting saves simply because the console doesn‚Äôt ask if you‚Äôre sure you want to close the game to continue (The PS4 did this, so why can‚Äôt the PS5) 3. You NEED to bring back the DLC menu. It‚Äôs there, but you‚Äôve hidden it ‚Äì it used to randomly appear as an advert, labelled ‚ÄúAdd ons‚Äù, but then you stopped it from appearing altogether. The DLC menu has the ability to sort and filter every single piece of DLC without having to check all your games one by one and hope there‚Äôs a new piece of DLC and you can find it on the store. This menu shows you all the latest DLCs in date-order, letting you sort by name, date, price, and filter by soundtrack, levels, in-game items, etc‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs literally there in the background, you just need to assign it a static place on one of the store pages ‚Äì maybe replace one of the many Free to Play tabs (as there is one on almost every page of the store, two on the first page!) You also have a serious issue with games not removing the ‚Äòcoming soon‚Äô flag once they go live, resulting in over 900 games on the store being incorrectly listed and hidden below over 8,000 other games. I‚Äôve talked to Shu about this and over 300 developers and publishers over the last three years ‚Äì this is a major issue and I‚Äôm willing to talk to your UI team and provide detailed instructions on where the issue lies and how to fix it :)",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/31/ps5-beta-rolls-out-today-with-new-accessibility-and-audio-options-social-features-and-ui-enhancements/

2300,CommandingTiger,"July 23, 2023 at 7:42 pm PDT","Can we talk about the project Q?Like what even is that?It feels like a split Dualsense with a low end tablet found on Ali Ex-press. It looks very cheap.That thing CANNOT cost more than 150$, 170$ at max if it is just a controller. What are you thinking?We asked for a hybrid console like the Switch but from PlayStation and Thus is what I get?We would have taken a 6 to 7 inch screen, with huge front facing speakers. but you put top facing speakers? ONLY 3 Hours of Battery life?! That‚Äôs because the screen size eats the battery up. The hybrid device we want is basically like the Q-Lite, but you actually attach a powerful Ryzen APU that rivals the PS5 in terms of power, those chips exists. Then you can detach that portion from the Q-Lite and dock it making it a PS5 slim. The dock would have hdmi out, 3 usb 3.1, ethernet, an optical disc drive and a SSD expansion slot.(and aadditional cooling solution) combining both the Q-Lite and PS5 slim would essentially make it a hybrid console you can take on the go.Instead your doing half bad job and turning it into a Wee U only device. The fact it‚Äôs using Android as opposed to a dedicated OS gives me 0 hope for this device being a complete waste. If you‚Äôre not going to make a Switch like hybrid home/mobile console then you might as well cancel it before you‚Äôre forced to sell them for 50$ in a clearance. What we want is a Switch like handheld but with the power of the A s u s R O G Ally.We do NOT want the Logi-tec G-Cloud. The handheld PS5 can be either a home console or a portable device, when it is docked, it gets access to a bigger library of games from digital to physical as well as a performance boost, not draining the battery of the handheld portion, the Q-Lite. The Q-Lite hybrid would retain the touchscreen, unlike the switch that disposes of it when docked. So let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs plugged in the wall, the screen can act as it‚Äôs TV if no TV is available without draining the battery as much while boosting performance.You can charge 500$-600$ for all this portable hybrid console.Price is not a issue, Purpose is.  It all it is, is a controller, then 150$ is more than enough.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/21/share-of-the-week-noir/

And then you look at Xbox and compare their 2020 showcase and in 2023 Halo is a dead franchise, and they put out a horrible Fable cinematic trailer and Avowed gets a MASSIVE cartoony downgrade. The only problem with PlayStation is that we have practically nothing new announced since Horizon, GT7 and God of War Ragnorok launched (or anything us PlayStation fans actually care about and none of that utter gack from that showcase 2 months ago). But why am I wasting my time saying that here on a PlayStation blog the past 2 years since Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart came out? You long stopped caring about what we have to say anymore.

Anyone with half a brain can easily point out the flaws in that logic. 1) If the product doesn‚Äôt sell well enough to justify the port on the new platform it loses money or breaks even. Guess what has happened with more than a few of their releases like Sackboy. Go google it. 2) Hardware eventually does make a profit once it becomes cheap enough to manufacture. Sony is no stranger to hardware refactors and price drops. Eventually that does lose them money down the line. 3) Steam is almost like a 1st party at this point. Sony has to pay Valve for every release they put on their store front, essentially reducing the amount of money they make.  Unless we start seeing a PlayStation OS or PlayStation Launcher on Windows, don‚Äôt expect this to ever change. (believe me I‚Äôd love to see either of thsoe things). If memory serves valve‚Äôs cut is bigger than what sony asks of 3rd parties on  playstation. This idea that its ‚Äúgood‚Äù to release it every where to get the greatest number of eyeballs doesn‚Äôt really hold much water the minute you start examining the technical debt that happens from it. A lot of these studios leave their PC versions for development purposes in pretty abysmal states the closer they get to release. That isn‚Äôt even getting into the lack of feature sets they‚Äôll need to bolt on, testing across multiple configurations, learning how to make things tick on PC like they do on a console. This where things get bad. The success and support of your platform stems from its popularity. Imagine a certain sony license does make it big on PC, which do you think will get more attention in the future. We see it already with titles that sell better on playstation.

True, but unlike previous generations, game development budgets are getting astronomical so waiting for the hardware to get cheap enough to turn a profit isn‚Äôt realistic anymore. 3. Steam has a 70/30 cut that goes up to 75/25 after it hits $10m in sales, then 80/20 after it hits $50m. While they‚Äôve been at this for a few years now, Sony is still getting their footing in the PC space. With that being said, only a couple of games they‚Äôve released had significant bugs; so far all of which are or have been ironed out.

Could even have included that entire library to PS+ Premium to make that service actually worth the asking price. But no. Just PC releases, that‚Äôs all you seeming to care about. When will PS5 see a first party game from a studio that isn‚Äôt insomniac or some unnecessary remaster/remake that actually makes console owners feel the console is half worth a?

They need to do this because Steam charges a 20% to 30% fee on each sale depending on how popular the game is.

I mean, free-to-play and MMO subscriptions don‚Äôt require that PS+ subscription to play anyway and if you want to promote these new IP franchises, people have to take into account getting a PS+ subscription anyway, so removing that requirement, at least for first-party titles, would promote your games anyway and won‚Äôt hurt your overall subscription numbers as Essential still releases great games overall.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/07/06/first-details-on-helldivers-2-co-op-and-combat-gameplay/

If you‚Äôre not interested in completely removing the online requirements, you can make a 25$ a year lite option with online multiplayer and cloud save and bonus sales promotions with multi-player dlc bonuses not counting Essential-tiers games access which has been accumulated over 3 generations of consoles and the PSP/Vita.

They‚Äôd be very different styles in game play. It‚Äôs far far from being Souls like, this game is wayyy too easy even without the items to help.The only item I would recommend to equip is the automatic Togal because you have to use the D-Pad removing your thumb for dodging on the analog stick and liberate the d pad for item usage, the others just breaks the game. I think they see the sales for turn base games and the market is not large enough, but maybe they can implement both as I mention earlier.Hopefully games like Super Mario RPG will show there‚Äôs interest in the genre and get new people invested in the genre, it is a game I am Super hyped for, along with Spider-Man 2",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/21/how-final-fantasy-xvi-respects-the-series-past-and-embraces-the-future/

The animations are fairly smooth with some of the directional combat feeling a bit off when not locked on. The worst part is the blocking and dodging. The environment makes it really easy for enemies to corner you, there are tons of little obstructions that cant be broken and you can get stuck really easy because of the weak sidestep dodge. The game encourages blocking but it feels more based on luck than actual timing. First death was on the first boss in the circus. It took hours to beat him because i was focusing on trying to get the block down. You can make it to the first boss without blocking once but then you MUST master it in order to continue. Once i finally beat it i wasnt looking forward to continuing. It was far more frustrating than fun and didnt come with a sense of accomplishment at the end.

It has many similarities in its narrative with Bloodborne; Ergo = Blood Healing,  Ashen Blood = Petrification disease(?). I just hope that it is different enough to establish its own identity. *Combat: Basic and Strong attacks felt good. My main concern so far is the Legion Arm Loadouts never were that useful and there didn‚Äôt seem to be additional attack animations right after dodging or running forward, so the encounters lacked some fluidity. Aside from leveling, the P-Organ (mechanical heart?) progression system may serve to add additional depth, but it is something you only get to try at the end of the demo. As you progress through the game I want to see more creativity for combos and weapons. *Graphics and Level Design: The look and feel of the world feels very polished. You can expect the classic Souls-like shortcuts, being ambushed on narrow alleys and resources hidden around every corner. 0",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/08/lies-of-p-demo-available-today-contains-first-two-chapters/

They seriously should consider delaying for one year to fix this: Combat is extremely sluggish, hit boxes are not clear, and if fighting based on bloodborne mechanics (focus on dodging versus blocking), it is extremely frustrating and not fun due to how slow the character moves and how small the hit boxes are (also inaccurate). When dodging bosses and trying to attack afterward, movement is so slow that you cannot get rewarding hits into the enemy ‚Äì it is a slog. And if choosing to block in combat, the frames for when an enemy is open to a perfect block are not clear enough. The game should be difficult as it currently is, but the player should be able to properly study enemy moves a bit better.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/06/08/lies-of-p-demo-available-today-contains-first-two-chapters/

Will there be a discounted or Free path to Elite Edition for those that bought the ‚ÄúBattlefield Ultimate Edition PS4 & PS5‚Äù bundle?‚Äì  Many players, including myself, pre-ordered Battlefield 2042 Ultimate Edition at full retail price via Pre Order.‚Äì I have personally pre-ordered Battlefield 2042 Ultimate Edition on June 9th 2021 (when the preorders first went live) and paid the full retail price of $119.99 USD.‚Äì I have played the game nearly every day since launch (November 18th 2021) on my PlayStation 5.As I‚Äôm writing this post there‚Äôs currently no upgrade path on the PS Store or In-Game to upgrade to Elite Edition from Ultimate Edition unless you pay at full retail at $99.99 USD. 2. Will you be bringing ‚ÄúPlatoon‚Äù Support to Battlefield 2042? (both In-game and via Battlelog stats)‚Äì Allowing for other Platoons to compete with each other in-game‚Äì Showing stats of the entire Platoon‚Äì Allowing Communication via Microphone and Text Chat in-game so an entire Platoon can work together as a unit. 3. Proximity voice chat‚Äì  Allowing players to communicate with other teammates in a close range such as calling for a revive, ammo, support such as repairs or calling out an enemy nearby. 4. Squad Management‚Äì Allowing the squad leader to remove/kick a player from the squad that is not contributing to the squad such as a player that‚Äôs AFK or never following squad orders (Sticking together as a squad) 5. More Maps‚Äì commitment in the future to adding more maps to the game 6. Year 2 support‚Äì  commitment in the future to support the game beyond season 5 for game improvements, weapon balances, vehicle balances, new weapons, new vehicles, new cosmetic skins for weapons and vehicles. Battlefield 2042 is just starting to get to a point where it needed to be at launch in regards to smooth gameplay, balances between Infantry and vehicles and all the little things in between but there‚Äôs still work to be done that the community would like to see improved and or added to the game as I mention above some of the big items that I and my Platoon would like to see added to the game.

I would be more than willing to invest if they managed to make it a handheld digital-only PS4 fine-tuned to stream PS5 games, especially considering the PS4 is already more than capable of remote playing PS5 games. I really don‚Äôt think the design helps its case: a large screen shoved into the middle of a controller doesn‚Äôt exactly seem ergonomic or portable. The biggest blow for me is the lack of an OLED screen, especially considering the Vita had it nearly 10 years prior. I suppose the price still remains to be seen, but with the licensed Backbone accessory costing $100 alone, I don‚Äôt see this being reasonably-priced enough for it to be a worthwhile proposition to most people; even if it works as seamlessly as a certain other console‚Äôs ‚Äúgamepad‚Äù accessory, it seems far too niche to really catch on.

I haven‚Äôt played Marathon on PC back in the day, so it‚Äôs looks interesting as Bungie‚Äôs first reboot of a beloved PC classic. Ghost Runner 2 and Phantom Blade 2 looks awesome. The biggest issue is 5 things:1. The appearance of Final Fantasy 16.

The trailer just already came out online 3 weeks ago, I‚Äôm looking forward to the film, but can‚Äôt you get a behind the scenes featurette or something? Terrible botch timing to release the same trailer, Sony.3. About Foamstars, what is this? A knock-off of Splatoon (which still continues to have a loyal following on the Switch) and then turn it into a live-service game. What kind of ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù are you talking about Crying Jim? You have learned nothing from what other live-services games failed to live up to their expectations (Babylon‚Äôs Fall, Marvel‚Äôs Avengers, etc.)4. A PlayStation Dualsense Handheld Thingy.

3156,KazeEternal,"May 25, 2023 at 12:04 pm PDT","Wifi exclusive Project Q? I got a wishlist for you: 1) Give USB-C hub support for wired Connections. I do this with my phone to get a much more stable connection to my PS5 when remote playing. WiFi in my house is ok and will be getting a Wifi6 overhaul eventually, but my 1gig network is better suited and works great with my PS4 and Phone when remote playing my PS5. 2) Make this sucker have a dock. Not just a charging dock, but a TV dock. I want to be able to dock this device to my TV and allow me to have a full PS5 like experience, using an actual dual sense. No need to go crazy with detachable groups that attach to a controller dock with a touch pad in the middle (though appreciated). If I‚Äôm playing in another room away from my PS5 and the TV suddenly becomes free in that room and I don‚Äôt want to go to the other room, it would be nice to just dock and play. I‚Äôd buy multiples of these docks for each room with a TV if this was a thing.  A lower cost charging dock without all the bells and whistled would be a nice accessory as well. 3) I‚Äôm already asking for Dual Sense support in number 2, so this should be a natural fit. Bluetooth support for multiple devices. Headsets, controllers, keyboards. etc I want it all. Look overall I‚Äôd rather have a PS Vita 2 with backward compatibility with digital PS4 games. If this thing is going to be what I think it is, we‚Äôre looking at a 200 dollar product which is going to make people ask ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you just make a Vita 2?‚Äù I doubt it‚Äôll be 100 dollars like the backbone. My little wishlist here will certainly push that price up. So go the distance, don‚Äôt stop short like with the Vita (no tv out and stupid touch screen, zero innovation to adopt Dual Shock 3/4 layout) and PSP (lacking a second analog stick and again no TV out or Dual Shock support till PSP Go which was a dumb move to do to the PSP2000 and 3000).",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/playstation-showcase-recap-everything-announced-at-todays-show/

3167,CommandingTiger,"May 27, 2023 at 7:34 am PDT","The Asus ROG Ally that has similar Teraflops as a PS5 is retailing at 700$. I don‚Äôt see how they could be able to make a system as powerful as a PS5 on a mobile device and not charge the same if not more than a PS5. Which is probably why they have this Q Lite as a stand-alone device because you can put in different powered hardware attached to the back of this Q Lite device. So if you‚Äôre only willing to spend 400$, you‚Äôd get a portable device as powerful as a PS4 Pro (that‚Äôs with the Q-Lite), but won‚Äôt play PS5 games.  You want the bigger hardware, then you‚Äôre spending more on this device to get a full PS5 out of it. Then you‚Äôre probably looking at 600$ in total minimum. I totally agree with you that we need a new PSP type device,  Sony however will Not make any other games than their AAA for console nor compromise the experience. However, we‚Äôre not dealing with completely different architecture, it would be all Ryzen and basically run all the same games, except in a portable way. If you just want the Q-Lite, you‚Äôd basically stream games either via Remote Play or Cloud Streaming with PS5 server blades, these are coming down the line so that‚Äôs why they are waiting to show more on the device. Depending if they get the patents, they can make the dual sense controller detachable onto a middle portion holding the touchpad similar to Nintendo Switch. The good thing about the Q-Lite is that you can keep this device and just upgrade the hardware that runs games separately from the 9 inch OLED screen. So if a PS6 version comes up, then it would be cheaper than buying a whole new device. -Replaceable battery is a must.-Hall effect sensor analogs is a must, reduces cost by fixing stick drift.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/playstation-showcase-recap-everything-announced-at-todays-show/

As a Wipeout, scifi and retro fan, I love the setting, music visual artstyle and the vibes of the teaser. The downside for me it‚Äôs that outside a few exceptions (like Street Fighter or Wipeout, or some coop stuff in games like Destiny) I only play single player stuff. I‚Äôm not interested at all in competitive stuff, I prefer to play alone enjoying some good narrative and fun experience instead of frustrating competitive modes that require to spend too much time (which I don‚Äôt have) in a game to be fun. So if you aren‚Äôt including a single player campaign (even if it‚Äôs a short one like in CoD), please consider it for the future when possible as post launch content. Because even if I buy a lot of games and I was looking forward to this game because of the pedigree of the team and because I trust PS Studios, I never buy or play PvP only games. So if it‚Äôs PvP only, -specially if narrative free- I won‚Äôt buy it. In addition to this, I prefer game announcements where gameplay is shown, or minimum some tiny beats like in the Helldivers 2 announcement, or at least some in-game cinematics that show/explain a bit how the game looks, plays and feels. And Sony, I‚Äôm ok with some -not all- Sony games being released in PC 2 or 3 years (better if even later). But releasing all/most of them on PC, and specially releasing them day one on PC will dillute your brand and people will lose the need of buying your console, buying in your digital store, paying your game subs and buying your accesories.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-concord-a-new-pvp-multiplayer-fps-from-firewalk-studios-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/

In all honesty PvP could have been awesome if given the time later that it needed. Seemed like a have a cake and eat it too situation that just blew up in bungies face when they realized they didn‚Äôt have the resources to balance a PvE space at the same time as PvP.

So if I understand correctly, the game will have two completely separate modes, one is a single player action RPG, and then there‚Äôs a 4 player co-op mode that sounds like it‚Äôs separate from the single player story. They mention ‚Äúin single player mode, the CPU controls the other three members of a party, providing vital support‚Äù, does this mean that both modes can actually be played fully offline, or am I misunderstanding how this works? My second question is, how expansive is the single player RPG portion of it, I‚Äôm hoping it isn‚Äôt just a tutorial or something but where most of the game is located. I get the hopes for co-op is probably to make a long lasting service game, but I‚Äôm just not a fan of those kinds of games and I want to make sure there‚Äôs going to be plenty of single player _offline_ content to keep me busy.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/two-new-playable-characters-join-the-granblue-fantasy-relink-roster/

Second of all, I honestly don‚Äôt get the people who say SO easily that they won‚Äôt buy such a great game because it‚Äôs digital only!I get that some people love physical copies and are disappointed not to have one, but not supporting an otherwise great game due to that fact seems a bit harsh. ‚Äì If it‚Äôs a price issue, it‚Äôs already cheaper than most AAA games and there should be an additional discount at some point anyway.‚Äì If it‚Äôs the worry that you won‚Äôt be able to sell it if you don‚Äôt like it ‚Äì check out the reviews before buying to make sure you really do want it. If it‚Äôs a great game (which by the looks of it, it‚Äôs gonna be), most people would want to keep it to their collection anyway.‚Äì If it‚Äôs a collector‚Äôs / preference issue, I get it, I‚Äôm with you, but is it really a reason to miss the joy of playing this game in whatever form it‚Äôs available? On the one hand we complain when there‚Äôs a shortage of good games but on the other we won‚Äôt support a good game due to something like this. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

Anything more than a few dollars is too much to pay for a temporary licence to a download.  There is no way I would ever pay $60 or even $30 for just a download of a big game like this. That‚Äôs the issue. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a shortage of good games. There is a plethora of great games available.

3504,Hellooooo_Nurse-,"May 25, 2023 at 4:54 pm PDT","People keep saying it‚Äôs just a Splatoon clone with a dense small minded outlook. It is very much a Splatoon Clone obviously. So what! That‚Äôs not a bad thing as Splatoon is fun as heck. Playstation doesn‚Äôt have access to anything like Splatoon since it‚Äôs a Nintendo 1st party IP exclusive. We get 3,000 shooters a year that are just like Doom, Halo, Call of Duty, or some zombie apocalypse game. Nobody complains about them being clones or what they are influenced by, they just play them and hopefully enjoy them. We get one Splatoon clone in the history of ever and everyone is outraged smh. Get over it! Keep that same energy the next time a Call of Duty clone or another zombie horde shooter is released. Also, Splatoon 3 has a lot of problems and room to improve. Like constant communication errors and disconnections because of P2P and not dedicated servers. No built in Team Voice chat, No easy invite system, Slowdown framerate issues especially in Salmon Run, lower resolution because of hardware limitations. And not being able to play ranked with your friends to name a few. FoamStars, could deliver a awesome expeirence to Playstation users because it will have the advantage of be powered by a PS5. Where we can at the very least have team voice chat built in and consistent framerates with smoother animations potentially. I love Splatoon and I have played it to a very high level and I will continue to play it. Nonetheless, I am open to this as well on my PS5. If it‚Äôs fun I will play it. If it‚Äôs bad o‚Äôwell it‚Äôs a opportunity missed by the developer. Either way there is enough room in the marketplace for another Splat-Like shooter. I just hope it has Gyro Aim (motion sensor aim) since its mimicking everything Splatoon so closely. Thats one of the most important and iconic features to me of the experience. PS4 and PS5 controllers both support motion aiming. So no excuses to not includeit as a option. I also hope it feels like a proper PS5 game. Not filled with obnoxious micro transactions for every little bit of the game. Or everything being pay walled behind nonsense currencies. I just hope Square Enix sets out to make a fun game.

Also, the artstyle, character design and music seems too generic with too obvious references. I‚Äôd push a bit more in the sci-fi/futurish/cyberpunk part (but making it different from Watchdogs) and try to find more in this part a more unique and iconic art style while at the same time to try to differentiate it from other heist games like Payday or GTA Online. Remember that many of the classic and iconic Sony games/IPs since the PS1 days had a very unique visual art style, a very unique music style and at least one very unique gameplay. Remember Journey, Wipeout, Parappa, Loco Roco, Uncharted, Gran Turismo, Bloodborne, Gravity Rush, Team Ico, Horizon games and many more. Yes, they had their solid references.

This is so worn out and it‚Äôs tone deaf coming from a company that, just as much as billionaires, is trying to make money, and given that this will be a GaaS, it will do so in predatory ways. I would venture that there are many billionaires who have made their fortunes in much more honourable ways than GaaS with mtx. The Robin Hood comparison is particularly out of place because Robin Hood stole from the rich *to give to the poor*. He didn‚Äôt steal to make himself rich which seems to be the premise of this game‚Äì the game does a disappointing attempt to be ‚Äòhip‚Äô and ‚Äòcool‚Äô with Gen-Z characters and edgy haircuts etc. Not my style and given the amount of dislikes on the YT video, not anyone‚Äôs style‚Äì the cartoony, colourful aesthetic is extremely generic and done so many times in recent years. From Sony fans begging for Killzone/Resistance/SOCOM when it comes to GaaS it must have been clear Sony fans prefer a grounded/gritty experience rather than sci-if/cartoony and wannabe hip‚Äì Sony is attempting to force GaaS on its mostly single player loving fanbase. It would have probably been a better tactic to slowly ease them into it, ie give a popular Sony IP with a good single player a multiplayer mode in addition. This is how GTA Online became so popular because people bought GTA V for the single player and stayed for the multiplayer. TLOU2 Factions would have been perfect for this, but that got delayed and will probably get cancelled. I can give Sony a prediction: people who are into TLOU, Uncharted, GOW etc are not going to suddenly jump onto a colourful cartoony GaaS with a cringy anticapitalist narrative.

3573,aquilla,"May 25, 2023 at 3:10 pm PDT","(Repost ‚Äì What happened to the last one?! üòØüòê .) While I remembered quite a bit of the following and the PS Blog gives quite a detailed description of the differences between the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù R32 GT-R and the Nismo, reading Wikipedia and indeed from memory, technically its‚Äô description blurs the lines between ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 1990 Nismo and 1991 N1 Nismos, while there were further changes added to the N1 models with V spec I and V spec II versions coming out in 93 and 94, as well as separate non Nismo, V spec I and II‚Äôs which were produced in larger numbers than Nismo models‚Ä¶ While I saw several comments saying, ‚ÄúWow, another GTR!‚Äù, this is only the second R32 model to now exist in GT7, after the already included non Nismo, 1994 V spec II ‚Äì for comparison, completion and choice, as well as to match the older GT games, we need about ten more R32 Skylines in the game!! üòØüòÇü©≤üòÄü§òü§û Some of the following is noted in the description, all Nismo models include airflow and aerodynamic changes and improvements over standard GTRs, no rear wipers as well as no ABS brakes, as ABS isn‚Äôt allowed in Group A racing, while its‚Äô removal also saves weight‚Ä¶ As with normal GTRs, all Nismos include aluminium bonnets and front panels, which is possibly lighter than in normal GTRs . While the radio is removed as standard, it can be put back in optionally in normal Nismo models, while all Nismos are fitted with 16‚Ä≥ wheels and 225/55/R16 tyres as standard and feature cross drilled brake rotors ‚Äì they can be fitted with 17‚Ä≥ wheels as options, among other options, including sports exhausts and suspension braces. Quite interestingly, the replacement of the standard GTRs turbos for Nismo models was done in favour of reliability rather than performance and likely suffer from more turbo lag as they sacrifice spool up speed for their added reliability ü§îüòØüòÄü§ò . All normal Nismos were Gun Grey Metallic, while N1 models come in special thinner, lighter Crystal White paint ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs the N1 models that completely remove the radio, speakers, air conditioning and even the carpet from the boot!! N1 models also include a reinforced master brake cylinder and additional brake cooling ducts‚Ä¶ From 1993, the V spec I (or VICTORY Spec! üòÄü§ò), N1s added Brembo brakes, a retuned ATTESA E-TS system, and 17‚Ä≥ BBS wheels with 225/45/R17 tyres, as standard. The V spec II in 94 only increased the tyre and wheel width and size to 245/45/R17, with no other changes noted‚Ä¶ Possibly only the V spec II but likely the V spec I as well is noted as being 50kg heavier than a standard GTR and 80kg heavier than a standard Nismo, likely due to their larger and heavier wheels. There were various tuned special editions then, such as the 10 Zero R‚Äôs built by HKS with 591hp, which it‚Äôs believed only 4 remain in existence! üòØüòÄü§ò .",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/gran-turismo-7-update-1-34-adds-3-new-cars-engine-swap-extra-cafe-menus-and-more/

It happens you have to remember to set ‚Äúappear online‚Äù otherwise no one of the friends you wasnt to can see you are online again.SOLUTION: Please SPLIT the online status which SHOULD be separate between consoles and PS App to have a smooth and not frustrating experience, better said, the online status of the PS-App should be PERMANENT and overwritten by the status of the console ONLY when you log-in, example, I‚Äôve set the status on the PS App to ‚ÄúOffline‚Äù, I log in onto the console, I appear as the last status ‚Äúon the console‚Äù, defaulting to online, whichever status I have set on the App, when I log-off onto the console I should appear on the App based on the status set on the same, NOT the one of the console.I hope to have explained myself enough.Thanks in advance for any attention.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/11/how-to-optimize-your-gameplay-with-the-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller/

Some were not born at the time of the original Killzone. Remastering the games and getting people excited would be a good idea. Killzone is an iconic series for PlayStation and has had a strong multiplayer community. It‚Äôs a wonderful candidate for a PlayStation live service multiplayer shooter. Imagine remastering the first game with a multiplayer component that lives with the games. Remaster the second one as the live service multiplayer keeps evolving.

3763,AlaskanHandyman,"May 16, 2023 at 4:12 pm PDT","I upgraded from a PS3 to a PS4 because a game I loved had a DLC that was only available on the PS4.   Historically developers have had to stop developing for older platforms because it becomes too difficult to support multiple versions of the same game when one generation of a console can do something that the other cannot, and performance suffers on the older console. I still have to have the PS4 disc in my system to play Forbidden West on My PS5.  Between the changes to the controller and the 4K 120Hz HDR the upgrade to a PS5 is worth it if you can also upgrade the displsy that you are using to play your games.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/09/20-years-of-guerrilla-the-story-of-a-playstation-studio/

Elysium was ‚Äúgood‚Äù (not amazing), and Chappie just didn‚Äôt do it for me. I also saw Demonic and it was alright. Still need to see his OATS Studios content. Such a shame his Alien and Robocop films didn‚Äôt go through, but here‚Äôs hoping this film turns out to be a great watch. Also I wonder what film he‚Äôs working on here: ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs actually a dystopian science fiction script I sold to Sony that started the conversation.

I played on Xbox and 1vs1 vs a PC player the gap on maneuverability is notorious.Also not being able to remap your controls will mess with you. You use the same button to a) pick up a weapon b) revive a friend c) scream like a maniac.In the heat of battle you‚Äôll notice that. Also, the same button you use for ‚Äúmenu‚Äù during battle, is the same button you make the control mapping appear on screen‚Ä¶ The amount of overlapping is bothersome.

3962,aquilla,"May 11, 2023 at 12:54 pm PDT","The selection of cars in GT7 is ok, certainly better than Sport, but kind of terrible compared to older games in the series! In particular, it generally only has one version of various road cars, not always the best version available in real life and almost no newer refreshed or special edition models (and fewer older models, for that matter!) which is something the older games were very good at including! For example, I‚Äôm a big Mazda fan and while they have an impressive selection of racing and concept cars, the selection of road cars is very poor! On the 6, they only have the same (bloody diesel) 2015 model that was in GT Sport ‚Äì there‚Äôs no sign of any of the pretty significant model refreshs we got since and in particular no sign of the now three petrol engines it has since 2019* (or even the higher and lower power diesels available for the 6), nor any sign of the 100th and 20th anniversary edition models! While of the older models, the short run MPS is a must! (While some estate versions would be interesting to see and customise ü§îüòØüòÄü§ò.) On the fourth generation MX-5, they only have the 1.5L softtop, neither of the 2.0L engine, nor the hardtop or the 100th anniversary edition etc‚Ä¶ While the first gen MX-5 is present, it‚Äôs only the 89 version with no second, third generation or special edition models, such as the 30th anniversary edition. On the only recently added 3, it‚Äôs very strange that they only added the hatchback and not the saloon as well, while on older models, the 3 MPS would be nice to have as well‚Ä¶ üòØüòÄü§òü§û *The petrol engines available in Europe are 145hp and 165hp 2.0L engines and an unfortunately automatic only 2.5L 194hp version, which got a turbo in other markets!

4060,Hellooooo_Nurse-,"April 21, 2023 at 2:18 am PDT","That is really cool that this game has a retro look, but will still play and feel very modern and clean. I‚Äôm really interested in this game. While all of this is great. Above all, I‚Äôm hoping this game will have quality gyro aiming (motion sensor aiming) implementation for PS4/5 versions of Boltgun as a option. Not just limiting the gyro aim experience to the Nintendo Switch version only.  Or not implementing gyro aim at all. Which will definitely make the game DOA on the Switch for sure. Nonetheless, we PS5 owners want gyro aiming too, as our controller supports it as well. If this game doesn‚Äôt support gyro, unfortunately that is a huge deal breaker for me personally and many others that want this feature added. Hopefully, this game doesn‚Äôt let Quake (Remaster) out class it with quality good feeling gyro aim controls as a option. As Quake has usable functional gyro aiming natively on PS4/5. You know a legit retro shooter with modern control features as a option. Which is awesome! I‚Äôm hoping this game will follow suit and bring a great gyro aiming experience with the proper options in the settings to get it dialed in to the PS4/5 version of the game. Besides, gyro aiming not only enhances gameplay of shooters when implemented correctly. It does it Without the need of aim assist. It also doubles as a huge accessibility feature that makes FPS games possible for many people with various disabilities to be able to play. Not having this feature in the game is insensitive to the needs of those individuals. Hopefully, the devs at Auroch  Digital don‚Äôt screw this aspect up! We‚Äôll see when it‚Äôs released.

This is how you make an RE game. This is how all RE games should be made. Turning is still not quick enough imo, maybe I should change my settings. The next remake should be either Code Veronica or even RE Outbreak as a multiplayer co-op survival game to get out safely from infested cities like Racoon city, and multiple parts (maps) scenarios from it. Finding randomly placed ammo and weapons (granted a section should have more of the same ammo types as said found weapon but also other ammo type) and everyone starts with a basic handgun. Add to that a single player campaign, perhaps even a proper prequel to Jill Valentine‚Äôs story as we all know RE3 remake was quite literally cut in half or an in-between section that was never fully realized. The part I loved the most of the original RE3 was walking in downtown collecting loot, ammo and killing zombies.I also loved the upper town where you needed to go to different locations and on your choosing, you‚Äôd have Nemesis appear 1/2 times out of the 6 locations making a lot of replay-ability with choices to either run of fight. It can be a prequel to RE3 remake where she was in a closed safe sector of the city as the infestation was closed off where they though most the infestation was under control and needed sleep.  She also gets bitten so that brings the lucid dream of being infected. It would end would zombie bursting out of an alley fence and Jill escaping to the police controlled safe zone of the city. Nemesis is not yet present. As the original game, he only shows himself later, not in the downtown area before it gets overrun in RE3 remake.You have to imagine that this post apocalyptic zombie scenario did not just happen on day 1 for Raccoon City.  Why would Jill sleep despite obvious mayhem outside?  Because everyone needs sleep and she was ‚Äúchanging shift‚Äù  but one of the officers on duty Brad saw Nemesis breaking the defenses and making his way to Jill‚Äôs apartment.  It‚Äôs also Nemesis who broke the trough the barriers and compromised the downtown area. You could also make it that Nemesis burst from a wall in the restaurant and kills Brad as a nod to the original rather than thinking just a regular zombie killed him. Anyway, it would have it‚Äôs own scenarios, and over time you‚Äôd add more scenarios and outcome in the Outbreak game.You would upgrade your weapons over time.You could also have hoard modes where you kill as many zombies as possible. I feel like Capcom is maybe trying too hard with all these multiplayer games. It would probably be best to have 1 game to rule them all in that regard.Meaning, bring the other Mercenary modes within this Outbreak game as a universal hub for All Resident Evil Multi-player games still active.It‚Äôs pointless to divide the fan base across so many different titles.Outbreak should also contain Multiplayer Co-Op Mercenary Mode as well from RE4 and RE8, for those interested. Outbreak should contain many types of game play mode from Re:Verses to Co-Op Mercenary, to Escape infected cities scenarios on co-op. That‚Äôs just my opinion. Leave it as feedback. It would be a nice surprise just to have Outbreak as a remake. It does sound a lot like an RE5 remake in the works.If that‚Äôs the case, on top of bringing combat elements from RE4R and RE5, do you think it would be possible to upgrade your character to make new moves?From Round house kicks, to punches, to uppercut, to rushing in with a shoulder bash to frontal trusting with combat knife like Dante in DMC.  This also means you can affect stats that increases strength (damage from physical), speed, precision, endurance and health to increase your chances of survival.In RE4R, it wasn‚Äôt made very clear that mixing certain herbs increased Max Health. Maybe have a much bigger blade and have it be only 1 button press instead with the direction of the analog determining what move will be associated, such as front would be trust, back + hold button would be block, left of right would be left or right horizontal swing slash.  The knife combat is still pretty good in RE4, I changed my settings to 1 button press only and it makes more sense, I like the parry and counter mechanics and it needs to be implemented in the next RE5.  Of course, who can forget everyone‚Äôs favorite ability.  The boulder bashing!  Chirst is built to be a power lifter so maybe lifting heavy objects and throwing them could deal heavy damage.Throwing knifes also comes to mind for Sheva to prevent lost of bullets. That‚Äôs where accuracy and precision points comes into play. Just like strength only affects melee.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/06/the-mercenaries-for-resident-evil-4-is-available-today/

4090,nmendez79,"April 15, 2023 at 4:06 am PDT","Hello, This is a repost of a comment I made on an earlier blogpost for this game (with some edits). I just finished the base game on ‚Äúhard,‚Äù and I feel compelled to express my thoughts here, given the lack of meaningful options for players to provide any feedback. Playing HFW was one of the worst gaming experiences I‚Äôve ever had on Playstation (for context, I invite you to see my trophy list to see the games I typically play; I also play avidly on Nintendo and Microsoft platforms). The combat and some other core gameplay mechanics felt so awful at times that it completely decimated my overall experience with the game. The amount of stagger and knockdown in this game is astounding, and especially frustrating during timed events. At times I just put the controller down so that I could wait for Aloy to get back up. All of the ancillary events (hunting grounds, melee pits, arena, and races) were tuned horribly in terms of difficulty. Granted, I played the game on ‚Äúhard,‚Äù but ‚Äúhard‚Äù during these events felt much harder than the story missions and the game world overall. The bow used to tether enemies to the ground simply did not work. Melee combat was absolutely horrible (I had to ‚Äúcheese‚Äù one of the bosses because I kept getting killed, sometimes in just two hits). The melee combat tutorials were just terrible. Your in-game explanations for these mechanics were at times entirely inaccurate.  These are just some of the many complaints I have of this game. Despite these problems, I plowed through the game to get the platinum trophy. I am getting the DLC because I had already planned on doing that (indeed, that‚Äôs why I waited until now to play the base game). Having said that, if the combat isn‚Äôt tuned better, this will be the last Horizon game I‚Äôll ever play (at the very least this will be the last Horizon game I intend on purchasing at full price on day one). Please consider fixing these issues going forward. Thank you for your time. nmendez79",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/06/get-to-know-the-quen-of-horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores/

4149,CommandingTiger,"April 7, 2023 at 7:57 am PDT","Hey PS.  What are you thinking about this new ‚ÄúQ Lite‚Äù handheld system?  If it‚Äôs just going to be a remote play device, just put out remote play on more Android devices and the Vita and call it a day.  Either way, you need to port Remote play on PS5, the PS Vita can remote play the PS4 and there‚Äôs no reason to do the same with the PS5.If it‚Äôs remote play only, then it‚Äôs DOA.  It needs full PS4 and PS5 compatibility/emulation but at a lower performance. I don‚Äôt think you heard me correctly.  That system only made sense as a ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù controller with Remote Play ability with s bigger battery.That controller would add additional features and functions inside each PS5 exclusive games like inventory management, additional buttons actions, scope shooting zoom in vision for shooters, puzzle solving, RTS ‚ÄúStrategy games‚Äù selecting troops, etc.  It would be better than just a touch pad  It would require software and hardware to save on battery greatly, keep the screen off most of the time for a better battery efficiency  and a much bigger battery. This system only makes sense in a hybrid Handheld/Home console system.  Where instead of ‚Äúremoving the joycons‚Äù, it keeps all of it‚Äôs component, but removes the main system console chip, while keeping the little sister system for smaller tasks and functions. The main system would also have it‚Äôs own dock that would connect to the TV as well as connection itself to additional SSD memory and Blu Ray drive. You can make a Ryzen console with 16Gb of Ram similar to a mobile device like the Asus ROG Ally handheld with more power than the Steam Deck that would rival and surpass the Xbox Series S (since it has more Ram) meaning it would make it easy for third party games to port the game over that if it‚Äôs on Xbox Series S, then it has to release on this handheld system. With Ryzen architecture, it makes it significantly easier to port the games over to the handheld. You would just scale down on this handheld for 1080p, 30fps to 60fps. If you can run Horizon Zero Dawn on the Steam Deck, you can run Forbidden West on a stronger Handheld.It‚Äôs not like with the Vita using an outdated ARM mobile chip with low Ram like the PS3. The architecture is significantly too different and under-powered. This ‚ÄúQ Lite‚Äù would have a dock behind the console to sit the main console board. You‚Äôre still releasing PS4 games and handhelds are now much stronger than a PS4 now.   It would also feature Blue-tooth to connect to a PS5 or the handheld in dock mode. If you are just releasing this system as a remote play only controller, then there is 0 appeal and would be a waste of money for everyone, don‚Äôt waste your money.People can already remote play on their phone and that‚Äôs fine enough.The way it‚Äôs being described, I‚Äôd have to says that it is DOA and won‚Äôt sell well.  You need the whole package.You need to be able to play your PS5 games on the go (and PS4) while lower specs obviously.  It still needs 16Gb of Ram to avoid any memory issues like TLOU P! on  PC.Easy to port, mass appeal in Japan. People want a real handheld and it won‚Äôt affect the PS5‚Äôs graphics at all, just the resolution and fps. It won‚Äôt be having dedicated studios making handheld only games, but rather a handheld that emulates all PS4 and runs PS5 games. There‚Äôs way too many handheld consoles to miss out on the growing market. Also use SD, USB memory, M.2 SSD or traditional type of memory.  NO SONY OWNED MEMORY CARDS! They‚Äôre too expensive and don‚Äôt protect games.Blu-Ray games will need to be scanned once every 4 months or accessed via your PS5 from home to confirm you own that game for disc games.Your efforts to port games on this handheld will be significantly easier than those to port PS5 games to the wide array of PCs running on Windows with DX12.Be smart and it‚Äôll be a success.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/04/05/players-choice-vote-for-march-2023s-best-new-game/

Got a collection of games you always play that keep disapearing from the dash, PIN them. If anything we need more items on the dash bar. Not folders.

Ratchet and Clank PS5ReturnalHorizone burning shores It would be rough if ps5‚Äôs were still a scalper festival, but Sony has it available and at a cut price no less with Ragnarok digital. The good news is a 10 year old console the ps4 is worth something on resale, sell it or trade it at gamestop towards a ps5. I wouldn‚Äôt even want to go back to the pro and that was a big step up over base. If this was multi gen it would take away from the scope of the game if they used the ssd and other features accordingly. Some games switch to 5 to pc rig are just low to high settings but the truly transformative stuff requires a baseline. It‚Äôs why switch us living that ps3 life, with their ‚Äúhd rumble‚Äù on life support leaning all their basket on $60 3ds 2.0 games. Point is if you want more complexity you need the hardware iterations. 2011-2012 off the rack components for ps4 in 2023 don‚Äôt cut the mustard on 4k tvs. Nintendo knows that why they play the art style game mechanic music game, they have boxed themselves in their best games are better than their rivals despite their self imposed limitations not because of it. I want all ps5 tentpoles to be ps5 exclusive Spiderman 2 next needs to be that and will be, and will drive adoption more than any sony game thus far. But i appreciate you‚Äôd like to play this on what you have i get that, it will be on pc also. Worst case play the great stuff on your console while you save / decide on 5 etc. Devs want to make it cool, and 10 year old hardware is not that.

My son is excited about Zelda the most but this is up there having watched both new trailers this weekend. Might wait till the summer though so we can both play it. We played some of FO yesterday and it was very smooth and clean on 5 so it will be nice to see how it will have evolved and iteration on gameplay, new story, set pieces, platforming bosses etc. I am hoping this one has a better platinum, got that on jedi master was more fun bumping combat difficulty up if you are a veteran of these games, same as ragnarok, spiderman etc. If there are cosmetics in boxes and stems and nothing else it will be a huge fail, this was one of the largest short comings of the first game, and unlike the technical issues was never able to receive a remedy. I also hope they drop the cheesy push x to name of developer every death aka respawn, and the biggest thing personally is the straight up inferior copy / cribbing off dark souls bon fires. Make an original game here it doesn‚Äôt make the game better riffing from, and i say that as a from player. Dark souls does not equal Star Wars. I know why it was crow barred in and if this new one has these same gripes ill wait for a 50% off sale or whatever it will be in black friday week. EA discounts their games quickly. 90% off fallen order for example these days. I‚Äôd like this to do really well even with the shadow of TotK, but 1 was a 7.5-8 for me but a fun game to play overall, and the best star wars ip since pre Disney or maybe awakens if you love abrams and wholsale copying episode 4. I wouldn‚Äôt mind a cal movie at this point, he‚Äôs a great actor too available. But enjoy the game either way whoever is day one or otherwise.

Clearly they have upgraded the graphics to what the PS5 can do. But the main reason as far as anyone has said is there are large scale animations/battles that the PS4 could never hope to do in the game. PS3 came out in 2006, and nobody would have expected new releases for it in 2016 and you shoudl not expect new releases for PS3 a decade after it‚Äôs launch either, the only reason PS4 got the main game is PS5 adoption and availablility was not good yet.

Make it third person, exactly the same gameplay as the flat version. Kind of like how we play Astrobot or Moss. That would be amazing.

4257,nmendez79,"April 15, 2023 at 3:51 am PDT","Hello, I just finished the base game on ‚Äúhard,‚Äù and I  feel compelled to express my thoughts here, given the lack of meaningful options for players to provide any feedback. Playing HFW was one of the worst gaming experiences I‚Äôve ever had on Playstation (for context, I invite you to see my trophy list; I also play avidly on Nintendo and Microsoft platforms). The combat and some of the other core gameplay mechanics felt so awful at times that it completely decimated my overall experience with the game. The amount of stagger and knockdown in this game is astounding, and especially frustrating during timed events. At times I just put the controller down so that I could wait for Aloy to get back up. All of the ancillary events (hunting grounds, melee pits, arena, and races) were tuned horribly in terms of difficulty. Granted, I finished the game on ‚Äúhard,‚Äù  but ‚Äúhard‚Äù during these events felt much harder than the story missions and the game world overall. The bow used to tether enemies simply did not work. Melee combat was absolutely horrible (I had to ‚Äúcheese‚Äù one of the bosses because I kept getting killed, sometimes in just two hits). These are just some of the many complains I have of this game. Despite these problems, I plowed through the game to get the platinum trophy. I am getting the DLC because I had already planned on doing that (indeed, that‚Äôs why I waited until now to play the base game). Having said that, if the combat isn‚Äôt tuned better, this will be the last Horizon game I‚Äôll ever play (at the very least the Horizon game I intend on purchasing at full price on day one). Please consider fixing these issues. Thank you for your time. nmendez79",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/03/29/pushing-the-envelope-achieving-next-level-clouds-in-horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores/

4565,cyphre909,"March 9, 2023 at 8:42 am PST",Sadly I can only say the PS5 UI and UX is overall much worse than what was on PS5. It‚Äôs absolutely not optimized for bigger amounts of games which should be the default for QA as majority of PS5 users are coming with their big game libraries from PS4. I have 8tb external drive connected and on every power on  it takes 2-3 minutes to the PS5 firmware to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù the disk to be usable. PS4 had no problems with that and works immediately. Same delay on ps5 happens everytime I want to manage may installed games (no matter if on internal or external storage!) Another problem is managing the library. I have over 700 games and even with the badly implemented and limitted ‚Äúgames lists‚Äù it is total chaos. Why we can‚Äôt have simple folders as on PS4?

4591,turniplord,"March 9, 2023 at 3:57 pm PST","I wish there was an easy way for us to supply feedback and suggestions so that PlayStation knows what features we want and what things aren‚Äôt working. They can look at trends and how the system is being used, but if there‚Äôs something missing then they‚Äôll never understand this by looking at how existing features are being used. For example ‚Äì simply allowing us to press ‚ÄòOptions‚Äô on an installed game in the Game Library SHOULD give us the complete set of options to perform things such as looking for an update, accessing save data, or pinning them to the home screen. Instead, you have to literally load a game (even if you‚Äôre playing something else) so it appears on the home screen, then back out to the home screen again ‚Äì now we have the options. We shouldn‚Äôt have to do this. Another required feature is the ability to invert the controller sticks via the system menu ‚Äì either under accessibility or the DualSense Edge customisation. I don‚Äôt mean the option we have now, an option to FORCE it to invert in games that don‚Äôt support it. Xbox does this, as do a few PS4 3rd party controllers, but nothing on the PS5. Then we get to things like the ‚ÄòAdd on‚Äô tile being removed from the PSN store ‚Äì this was literally the only way to access all the new DLC items that had been released in a sortable list. It was perfect. But, it was originally an ‚Äòadvert‚Äô, so you had to be lucky that it appeared as the ads rotated, now you‚Äôve removed it from ever appearing ‚Äì this NEEDS to come back as a sticky tile in the store, publishers and developers are losing out on millions in purchases and consumers have no idea new content is out for games they own. There are a lot of features and tweaks we‚Äôd love to see, but there‚Äôs nowhere to voice these to PlayStation ‚Äì maybe you could have a forum for consumers, or even lock it out to level-4 people if you only want a few people recommending things (I‚Äôve been Level-4 for many months now).",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/03/09/inside-the-development-of-the-latest-ps5-system-software-update/

4600,mrc247,"March 10, 2023 at 2:00 am PST","My feedback on the new update is unfortunately negative. To say something positive, the wireless update of the controller worked perfectly, very nice!(But it‚Äôs about time that Sony offered the feature, Microsoft and even Nintendo have been offering the feature for years) What I don‚Äôt like at all is the new game hub: 1.) The trophy field is no longer visible at first glance, you have to scroll down first, this is not an improvement, on the contrary. 2.) The playing time of the games is still not counted correctly. e.g. I have already played God of War Ragnar√∂k for over 60 hours, but in my profile and now also in the game hub it says 34 hours. The fact that it is now so present in the game hub only makes me even more annoyed that Sony has not implemented this feature correctly. 3.) The Game Hub now also shows the progress in a game based on the progress of the main missions. In a game I‚Äôve just played through, however, only 86% is displayed. My guess is that it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt played the DLC. But I think a DLC should not be taken into account. 4.) I was happy that the PS4 feature that lets you see which friends have played a game has come back. But unfortunately the feature doesn‚Äôt seem to work properly on the PS5 with the update either. When playing God of War Ragnar√∂k, the Game Hub tells me that NONE of my friends have played the game. If I then click on the tile, however, it is shown to me that 17 people have it. Otherwise, it‚Äôs nice that you can finally sort the playlists, but why can‚Äôt I do it manually according to my own needs, but only according to the options provided by Sony??? Microsoft and Nintendo are doing a better job there too. Conclusion: With the wireless controller update, a long-awaited feature is finally coming to the PS5, but the new Game Hub is not a real improvement and unfortunately also has many bugs. Too bad Sony, another missed opportunity.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/03/09/inside-the-development-of-the-latest-ps5-system-software-update/

I am so happy and impressed with the direction it has taken and the future I see on the horizon.There is only one feature that I truly miss that I did & would still be using on a daily basis. The ability to check & respond to my PSN messages via my PC. While I game on my 78in OLED, I have an additional 24in screen to my left I keep my PC open on. It is too much an interruption to message on the PS5 as I need to pause jump completely out of game for that moment. The phone app is the only other option though because of it‚Äôs size I need to turn my attention completely to the phone to read & respond to my PSN messages.When I was able to use the PC I could glance at the 24in screen & easily see what was written without barely an interruption in my gaming & without looking away. Same with responding as I would use the desktop keyboard & could easily type quickly with one hand, (or extremely fast with two hands), either way it never noticeably interrupted my gaming. Responding via the phone app (for me anyway), requires me to put down the Dualsense & use both hands as well as full focus to read the small screen.It‚Äôs the only PSN feature that was on the PC that had significant value to me. I would really love to again see the ability to access PSN messsages via the PC. Though if it never returns I will still remain an extremely loyal & happy PS5, & future PS** gamer!!

4840,stage300handsome,"March 12, 2023 at 4:08 pm PDT","I see a lot always say we gamer‚Äôs that have grew up with PlayStation since its start have changed, I don‚Äôt agree with that at all. I think studios are the change, they are full of people who are creative, but like Hollywood have run out of ideals for the most part and as a company they are no longer concerned with your feedback on anything, they assume they have your business, and they pander to other crowds that aren‚Äôt really loyal to the brand or experience. Square Enix a great studio, and I‚Äôm looking forward to a lot of their titles, but I think they lost their magic of always coming up with titles that interest the base now because they try to do to much to please western audiences, when in truth the ones that will buy a title preorder or day one are not looking for western styles.And that brings me to the point now with this State of Play that I finally got around to watching because most of them the past yr haven‚Äôt been good or having something your wanting to see, even though Baldur‚Äôs and a few of the other single player rpgs and action adventures looked good , so much pushing the sucide squad and online ones along with the woke stuff, really kind of brought it done. But that is the best thing out what Sony is that during the Ps1 and 2 its was full of any genre you wanted. There‚Äôs still just as much variety as then but they all lean toward the same thing wanting online and free for all.I have two sons who like to game and for the past few yrs its been Fortnite and CoD nonstop back and forth all day that they can, and I have every system from the late 80‚Äôs up to now. And they have sat and played around with them in the past or sat and watched me, it was usually that looks boring or it cheats so bad, looks rough. But now that they have gotten older, I will see them try some different games here and there, and was really shocked to learn they got Legend of Dragoon and Wild Arms and been playing them the past few weeks. But apparently, they didn‚Äôt realize I had the originals. I found out by taking them out to Game Stop and a few local used gaming stores, they were looking where I was looking and I said guys used passed by the C‚Äôs already, then I heard my youngest ask a worker if they  had chrono trigger for Ps4 or 5 and I was like I got that at home if you want to play it, but its not on the newest consoles. They then came up asking questions about others, so they must have been researching or seen others watching their youtube videos on the games they play, I still don‚Äôt get that, but was kind of glad  they were trying some of my favorites now. And for the last month I haven‚Äôt heard shooting or all the Fortnite crazy sounds coming from their room. But Hey, maybe we will find out what Bluepoint has going on soon, or Insomniac‚Äôs known games like Spiderman or Wolverine since those guys at least get how to make superhero games, or maybe Ronin or one of the FF games coming up. I figure State of Decay will continue on like the monthly games on Plus, a once in a while shock you month.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/02/23/state-of-play-february-2023-all-trailers-and-complete-recap/
4841,Kadeemluvmusic,"February 23, 2023 at 3:11 pm PST","What‚Äôs with the hype, Sony? This doesn‚Äôt feels like a State Of Play showcase. The only good parts of the showcase were brand new gameplay footage of Resident Evil 4 and adding its Mercenaries level, which looks awesome. Street Fighter 6 gameplay looks unique adding three more characters, and a Naruto Ultimate Storm game, could be a remastered version of past Ultimate Ninja Storm games from the PS2/3 years. If it‚Äôs getting remastered, sign me up and take my money. As for the rest, well‚Ä¶about the new trailer for the game, Suicide Squad Kills The Justice League. We were all skeptical (and excited) for the game, Kevin Conroy‚Äôs final performance as Batman will be emotional and heartbreaking saying goodbye to one of the most beloved actor portraying The Dark Knight for 30 years.

CAPCOM is the worst at releasing EQUAL collectors editions around the world as well as BETTER VERSIONS being released to certain stores‚Ä¶. WE SEE YOUR SHADY ANTI-CONSUMER TACTICS releasing inferior versions to some of your biggest regions! THE USA NEVER GETS the LENTICULAR SLIP COVER versions of your games that you give to many stores around the world but screw over North America never sending it here! I bought the RE 2 & 3 remakes as well as Village collectors editions in the USA as well as Imported all the Japan Collectors editions to discover CACPCOM Japan went above and beyond making the packaging collector chest with raised textures, a well made lid which all extra fine details made it look like a real chest‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ THE USA collectors packaging for Resident Evil remakes did not have that extra love put into the design and could tell it was just a cardboard box taking way illusions that the Japan version gives! Why did Capcom even make two different boxes for their collectors Resident evil collectors editions; Amazing packaging for Japan, and the rest of the world got a crappy inferior box by far! THE WORLD SEES these shady tactics! What a  Bunch of BS to be SO SHADY with INFERIOR COLLECTOR PACKAGING to other regions! CAPCOM does this the WORST of any manufacturer, and are the most shady even more than Nintendo! Since you screw over the US every-time sending NO lenticular versions here for a chance to but I am forced to buy from a store over seas in the UK all my LENTICULAR versions. I had to Import Devil May Cry 5 LENTICULAR SLIP COVER version, Resident Evil 2  & 3 remakes with LENTICULAR SLIP COVERS, as well as RE VILLAGE with LENTICULAR SLIP COVER. But, for Resident Evil 4 Remake not yet released ShopTo are not offering any Resident Evil 4 Lenticular edition because they said CAPCOM chose not to give it to them as they gave it to other retailers this time. What a bad decision when CAPCOM clearly gave ShopTo all past Lenticular covers for all CAPCOM games; giving collectors a chance to continue their Lenticular collection consistently and now CAPCOM decided not to give ShopTO The Lenti cover for RE 4, WHY????? PLEASE FIRE THE ENTIRE MARKETING TEAM AT CAPCOM! They never CARE! Is it that hard to put yourself in the collector gamers shoes and realize you gave this retailer ShopTo  every other Lenticular version and should have clearly received this RE 4 Lenti version that other Unknown stores are selling i internationally. Also, neglecting the USA for some odd reason with these Lenticular versions is a horrible business decision! That Lenticular  RE 4 version should be able to be bought here in the USA as well, so you seriously suck CAPCOM for releasing certain BETTER versions unfairly around the world !!!!! THE WORLD FANS see CAPCOMS shady tactics with crappier packaged versions released in larger markets!  RELEASE THE BEST VERSIONS FAILRY AROUND THE WORLD! WHERE ARE THE LENTICULAR VERSIONS FOR NORTH AMERICA! FIRE THE PERSON THAT IS SELFISH and HIRE actual GAMERS that will make CAPCOM thrive better then they ever were! Keep ignoring fans, and this is why fans end up stealing a Companies products when they are continually ignored and doing things your own way; we‚Äôll just steal then! Your company can make more profits if you actually listen to the fans and stop being stubborn‚Ä¶. CAN JAPANESE COMPANIES PLEASE LISTEN AND RELEASE there packaging FAILRY! Stop being inconsiderate and stubborn! Thanks ALL STANDARD COPIES should be the LENTICULAR VERSION! Please Stop giving the International communities inferior packaging as well as not even giving better versions like the Lenticular covers to large countries and then making the best packaging for Japan is ridiculous! Maybe in the 90s when everyone wasn‚Äôt so connected to the Internet CAPCOM can pull off these SHADY TACTICS but  Now In Current times your fans all see what gets released in other countries. It is completely messed up that CAPCOM still does better packaging for Japan in current times when it just pisses off your collector fans!

Look what they did to their single player games, nickel and dime out the bat dlc, had loot boxes in shadow of moredollars and retconned it out after with the game worse for it. Look at the prior rocksteady game basically a different studio at this point. Knight has loads of dlc nonsense. It is easy to forget though with wb putting all the batman and mordor stuff on 75-85% off every week. They looked at the other pubs making bank on gas and mtx battlepasses etc and put the team on ip that could make that. So they could print money off this for years, ALL THE MONEY or it‚Äôs not enough, that gta5 momey, the destiny money. Nobody cares about suicide squad we wanted to play as the justice league not against them, and certainly not with bots. This thing is doa, and it‚Äôs a shame the arkham trilogy was and is excellent. They are so greedy and crass they won‚Äôt update the 3 games to 60fps on ps5 either, which is all we are really asking for. A leopard doesn‚Äôt change it‚Äôs spots. You need to give these companies the contempt and skepticism they have earned. No local coop, so no real friends, no sons with dads, brothers with brothers or any family combinations or couples that doesn‚Äôt involve 2 ps5s plus accounts etc smh. And I‚Äôm supposed to be excited for cosmetic bs polluting the screen? While playing character I dont care about shooting blue pus buttons. Yeah sure WB, take this game and its production value and put it with batmanless gotham knights because your greed blew it. Make what people actually want and we will pay you, simple. Im going to enjoy watching this game die just like Avengers. The fake out on Sefton Hill was priceless guy sold his shares and left, but they desperately want us to remember him and his part of the og trilogy, which we do.

Because of this because I‚Äôm still unsure if I want to buy a PS5 HD Camera for it since I see it as of no use to me since I don‚Äôt stream that often anyways. But able to stream it through Discord would be a big bonus for it, so that we can enjoy sharing game content to our Xbox and PC friends without need of using Twitch or YouTube Live. It is nice to see 1440p VRR support being added as well, but this one small thing that still turn off PS5 players because it still don‚Äôt have the G-SYNC/Freesync and HDMI 2.0 support for it as well, because people like myself who has gaming monitor that is 1440p and it has either G-SYNC or Freesync built in and it has only HDMI 2.0 input(s). So thus it is still preventing us out of ability to use VRR/ALLM feature on PS5 because of this merely HDMI 2.0 input and lack of support on G-SYNC or Freesync thus preventing us from using our gaming monitor to its fullest potential possible alongside with our gaming experience and enjoyment.

Even the Horizon Zero Dawn remake it‚Äôs supposedly being handled by a different team. If factions is day one PC is it really holding naughty dog back? TLOU2 2020, PT1 2022, Factions 2023. How has the very slow PC support in any way hurt PS5 first party support? Miles Morales, Spidey Remastered, Demon‚Äôs Souls, Returnal, R&C, Forbidden West, MLB, GT7, TLOU PT1, God of War Ragnarok, Spiderman 2, Factions, Call of the Mountain. 13 AAA first party games and 12 AAA first party exclusives in the first 3 years. MS currently has 2. SIE first party has been cooking since 2020. PSVR2 is another example of supporting PS5 as it‚Äôs exclusive to the console when it easily could have supported PC. I don‚Äôt understand why people are so threatened from years old PC ports. The same people that said Demon‚Äôs Souls was imminent for PC back in 2020. The same people that said Forbidden West would be on PC by September 2022. R&C? Tsushima? GT7? Destruction All Stars? Ragnarok? Are any of those games announced for PC? Yeah PS5 has no games lol. And even if games do come to PC years after release how does that take away from PS5? As long as these games still have a 1 to 2 year window it keeps PS5 desirable because believe it or not most people don‚Äôt want to wait years to play a hotly anticipated game just take a look at the fact that the majority of a game‚Äôs lifetime sales occur in the first year. The reality is PlayStation is producing software and hardware as well as services at a higher rate than they ever have. They are supporting the PlayStation brand more than ever. First party studios are larger and more numerous than ever. More exclusives are in production than ever before. Both first party and third party. They are supporting VR exclusively for PlayStation with more resources and games than ever. They have created a mobile division, a new PS+, service games,  premium controllers, headphones, VR, custom plates, added VRR, 1440p, PS stars, Discord support, accessibility controller, new iteration of PS5, more film and television projects than ever.",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/01/30/playstation-kicks-off-new-year-with-increased-supply-of-ps5-consoles-new-spot/

How can I get to download it? This looks bad for the future of downloads if we‚Äôre not allowed to access our games that are linked to our account with no explanation and just an error screen. I think if that‚Äôs going to be the case I will have to stick to physical media. Please help somebody.

Just do some research, Sony‚Äôs hmd largely has better specs than valve index which is about $1,000. You can argue PS VR2 is a more impressive set and it‚Äôs half the price. Have you seen the controllers?  Valve index controllers are $300 alone and Sony‚Äôs have haptics and adaptive triggers, obviously finger tracking and such. The headset is 4K OLED with foviated rendering, eye tracking, and haptics. Psvr was a toy, PS VR2 is a premium set and honestly for 550 that‚Äôs a deal but people are too stupid to realize that. I know anything over 500 looks bad but you have to understand the tech you are getting. If anything you can argue the Dual sense edge is a much worse deal by comparison but even that is about the going rate when you consider it has haptics and adaptive triggers which the other premium controllers do not. But I can understand if people want to complain about that price however psvr2 appears to be well worth the price for the tech you are receiving particularly considering you only need a PS5 to run it at maximum capacity. I‚Äôm so tired of the idiocy surrounding the psvr2 price point.

5817,KazeEternal,"December 20, 2022 at 1:36 pm PST","One request I‚Äôd love to make of this controller which I hope is possible with a firmware update. Making the rear buttons R4 and L4. I love that I can assign things to them for double purpose. That‚Äôs honestly my primary purchase reason. I‚Äôd prefer that the standard controller remain that standard for the time being. Some cases it would be nice to just have two extra buttons on the controller. God of War Ragnarok ironically is one such case. I‚Äôd have loved to of assigned the rage button to an R4 or L4 button. L3 and R3 are way to overloaded on that game, too many times I‚Äôd dash in and lock on at the same time, only to be met with confusion and panic as my meter depleted before my eyes during a berserk fight or other difficult encounter. Dare I say as much as GoWR is my GotY it makes a ton of stupid input and UI related mistakes. Some of which are completely unforgivable. For instance there should have been more care taken in handling weapon switching mid recovery and mid combo. I‚Äôm the sort who treats the D-Pad like it‚Äôs Gears of War with each weapon asigned to a direction. It gets confusing when your fists are considered a weapon and suddenly after pressing a button again puts your weapon again instead insuring you‚Äôre ready to start using the blades the minute you‚Äôre done with a spear. Something encouraged by the game with one of its relics mind you in order to activate a magic circle around your character. Mapping the rear keys is immensly helpful. As someone who has already modded a standard DSG2 controller and DS4 with those buttons its a blessing. Particularly with Crisis Core where some of its minigames forget that the thumb is now busy with an analog stick instead of burdening your index finger with camera control while picking up materia. Switching to my other controller from my God of War controller, made this mini game a breeze like I rememberd it on PSP. Thankfully that was a situation a Dual Sense Edge can solve (happy to get one btw, yay preorders). Letting R4 and L4 be a thing to fix over burrdened buttons. Would be a blessing. I think they only thing I didn‚Äôt try was remapping rage to the touch pad as a swipe up. Probably would have been the better idea. Thank the SMS team for adding swipe and Sixaxis options, they made my experience a dream.",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/20/dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-hands-on-key-takeaways/
5818,AgentOttsel,"December 21, 2022 at 6:07 am PST","For God of War Ragnarok, there‚Äôs actually an option to use Circle + X for activating Rage, which I find way better. That game has lots of great options, like swapping the Jump and Dodge buttons, gyro assisted aiming, Holding X (or Circle) next to an enemy instead of clicking the stick to activate brutal moves, etcetera. I definitely agree that we need actual separate inputs in the form of L4 and R4. I would even go for L5 and R5 like the Steam Deck, but unfortunately I think we missed that chance at the start of the generation, and now we can only hope that the PS6 controller will have those extra inputs by default, or that the DualSense Edge will support L4 and R5 on Steam (which they were able to do for the Xbox Elite controller‚Äôs 4 extra buttons).",https://blog.playstation.com/2022/12/20/dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-hands-on-key-takeaways/

Imagine in a FPS being able to hit the back button and it causes your character to pull their gun and look down the scope in one press.  I would love that for Sniper Elite 5, as an example.  The Steam Deck utilizes the track pads it has, and Sony can better utilize the track pad.  I would like to be able to program it as a switcher for weapons or abilities, freeing up other buttons for other actions.  Just a few suggestions Sony.

If you have congrats. You probably know about Battlefront and Battlefront 2 and Jedi Fallen Order. They are remaking Jedi Fallen Order to Jedi Survivor. New abilities new lightsaber customizations in fact if you preorder it will give a Han Solo blaster customization option and Luke Skywalker lightsaber customization option and Cal Kestis look like a redhead Obi-Wan Kenobi but you also pay extra which makes sense but that‚Äôs besides the point. The point is they remake games and consoles and PC‚Äôs for better graphics and gameplay. If they don‚Äôt do that PS WILL BE CANCELED and that means with NO PS, NO GAMES FOR PC! So be happy that you can purchase these games because for some of us GAMING IS LIFE and without that we wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with ourselves (we would go insane).
