No new game announcements, no actual new IP, and a cancelled project, that not only looked promising and fun, but it was promised as a part of TLOU2.  Instead, all you have done is port your games from PS4 to PS5 with little reason to re-buy them.  What are you doing?  How can the best PS Studio fall so hard.  You don‚Äôt have to release ‚Äúperfect games‚Äù.  You CAN release fun games at a higher rate.  Look at Fromsoft.

323,ModTheMod14,"November 16, 2023 at 4:43 am PST","The discussion has become much bigger than this game or Rocksteady for us gamers. It is about WB (and other companies in the industry) openly and shamelessly trying to force service game after service game down our throat, where not FUN or an AWESOME GAMING EXPERIENCE are leading game-development and decision-making but MONETIZATION, PLAYER RETENTION, FEAR OF ‚ÄúOVERDELIVERY‚Äù and other corporate buzzwords and behavioral psychology tricks, and it plainly and wholeheartedly just sucks!The ONLY language those corporates understand is MONEY, therefore a service-game like Suicide Squad, which asks a full premium price AND THEN more and more and more money through battle passes, skins and whatnot, should just not be supported by gamers. Look at Marvels Spider-Man 2, a game by Insomniac, a passionate single player oriented studio focused on delivering awesome experiences: they made a banger game, GOTY contender, where you also could unlock like 99% (without Deluxe Edition content) of cosmetics THROUGH GAMEPLAY, NOT GAMEPAY, and thats how it should be and should be honoured with our money: a premium price for a premium product! If YOU support Suicide Squad and ohter games like this, make no mistake: you are hurting yourself as a gamer, because the industry as a whole will move into a direction, where pretty much every game coming out will be an ALWAYS-ONLINE LOOTER SHOOTER FORTNITE CLONE with dumbed down gameplay and cut content, because they are selling it to you later. Please dont let them get away with this, Im begging you on behalf of gaming as the thought.provoking, creative, multifacetted and interactive medium we all love and enjoy (and btw: are also more than willing to pay for, just give us premium single player games, for gods sake, and bath in money!).",https://blog.playstation.com/2023/11/15/how-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-taps-into-ps5s-immersive-power/
